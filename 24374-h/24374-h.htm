THIRD EDITION</a></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">In preparing this revised
edition I have been able to make use of much information conveyed
to me by readers interested in the subject. The general
arrangement of the book remains unchanged, but a certain number
of statements have been modified, corrected, or suppressed. The
study of our surnames has been mostly left to the amateur
philologist, and many origins given by my predecessors as
ascertained facts turn out, on investigation, to be unsupported
by a shred of evidence. I cannot hope that this little book in
its new form is free from error, but I feel that it has benefited
by the years I have spent in research since its original
publication. I would ask reader to accept it, not as a
comprehensive treatise containing full information on any name
that happens to occur in it, but as a general survey of the
subject, and an attempt to indicate and exemplify the various
ways in which our surnames have come into existence.</font></p>

EDITION</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The early demand for a new
edition of this little book is a gratifying proof of a widespread
interest in its subject, rather than a testimony to the value of
my small contribution to that subject. Of the imperfections of
this contribution no one can be more conscious than myself, but I
trust that the most palpable blemishes have been removed in this
revised edition. The student of etymology seldom passes a day
without coming across some piece of evidence which throws new
light on a difficult problem (see Chapter XVI), or invalidates
what had before seemed a reasonable conjecture. I have to thank
many correspondents for sending me information of value and for
indicating points in which conciseness has led to
misunderstanding. Some of my correspondents need, however, to be
reminded that etymology and genealogy are separate sciences; so
that, while offering every apology to that Mr. Robinson whose
name is a corruption of Montmorency, I still adhere to my belief
that the other Robinsons derive from Robert.</font></p>

EDITION</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The interpretation of personal
names has always had an attraction for the learned and others,
but the first attempts to classify and explain our English
surnames date, so far as my knowledge goes, from 1605. In that
year Verstegan published his <i>Restitution</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Decayed</i> <i>Intelligence</i>, which contains chapters on
both font-names and surnames, and about the same time appeared
Camden's <i>Remains</i> <i>Concerning</i> <i>Britain</i>, in
which the same subjects are treated much more fully. Both of
these learned antiquaries make excellent reading, and much
curious information may be gleaned from their pages, especially
those of Camden, whose position as Clarencieux King-at-Arms gave
him exceptional opportunities for genealogical research. From the
philological point of view they are of course untrustworthy,
though less so than most modern writers on the same
subject.</font></p>
<p>About the middle of the nineteenth century, the period of
Archbishop Trench and Canon Taylor, began a kind of boom in works
of this kind, and books on surnames are now numerous. But of all
these industrious compilers one only, Bardsley, can be taken
seriously. His <i>Dictionary</i> <i>of</i> <i>English</i>
<i>Surnames</i>, published (Oxford Press, 1901) from his notes
some years after his death, is invaluable to students. It
represents the results of twenty years' conscientious research
among early rolls and registers, the explanations given being
usually supported by medieval instances. But it cannot be used
uncritically, for the author does not appear to have been either
a linguist or a philologist, and, although he usually refrains
from etymological conjecture, he occasionally ventures with
disastrous results. Thus, to take a few instances, he identifies
<i>Prust</i> with <i>Priest</i>, but the medieval <i>le</i>
<i>prust</i> is quite obviously the Norman form of Old Fr.
<i>le</i> <i>Proust</i>, the provost. He attempts to connect
<i>pullen</i> with the archaic Eng. <i>pullen</i>, poultry; but
his early examples, <i>le</i> <i>pulein</i>, <i>polayn</i>, etc.,
are of course Fr. <i>Poulain</i>, <i>i.e</i>. <i>Colt</i>. Under
<i>Fallows</i>, explained as "fallow lands," he quotes three
examples of <i>de</i> <i>la</i> <i>faleyse</i>, <i>i.e</i>. Fr.
<i>Falaise</i>, corresponding to our <i>Cliff</i>, <i>Cleeve</i>,
etc; <i>Pochin</i>, explained as the diminutive of some personal
name, is the Norman form of the famous name <i>Poussin</i>,
<i>i.e</i>. <i>Chick</i>. Or, coming to native instances,
<i>le</i> <i>wenchel</i>, a medieval prototype of <i>Winkle</i>,
is explained as for "periwinkle," whereas it is a common
Middle-English word, existing now in the shortened form
<i>wench</i>, and means <i>Child</i>. The obsolete
<i>Swordslipper</i>, now only <i>Slipper</i>, which he interprets
as a maker of "sword-slips," or sheaths, was really a
sword-sharpener, from Mid. Eng. <i>slipen</i>, cognate with Old
Du. <i>slijpen</i>, to polish, sharpen, and Ger.
<i>schleifen</i>. Sometimes a very simple problem is left
unexplained, e.g. in the case of the name <i>Tyas</i>, where the
medieval instances of <i>le</i> <i>tyeis</i> are to a student of
Old French clearly <i>le</i> <i>tieis</i> or <i>tiois</i>,
<i>i.e</i>. the German, cognate with Ger. <i>deutsch</i> and
Ital. <i>tedesco</i>.</p>
<p>These examples are quoted, not in depreciation of
conscientious student to whose work my own compilation is greatly
indebted, but merely to show that the etymological study of
surnames has scarcely been touched at present, except by writers
to whom philology is an unknown science. I have inserted, as a
specimen problem (ch. xvi.), a little disquisition on the name
<i>Rutter</i>, a cursory perusal of which will convince most
readers that it is not much use making shots in this subject.</p>
<p>My aim has been to steer a clear course between a too learned
and a too superficial treatment, and rather to show how surnames
are formed than to adduce innumerable examples which the reader
should be able to solve for himself. I have made no attempt to
collect curious names, but have taken those which occur in the
<i>London</i> <i>Directory</i> (1908) or have caught my eye in
the newspaper or the streets. To go into proofs would have
swelled the book beyond all reasonable proportions, but the
reader may assume that, in the case of any derivation not
expressly stated as a conjecture, the connecting links exist. In
the various classes of names, I have intentionally omitted all
that is obvious, except in the rather frequent case of the
obvious being wrong. The index, which I have tried to make
complete, is intended to replace to some extent those
cross-references which are useful to students but irritating to
the general reader. Hundreds of names are susceptible of two,
three, or more explanations, and I do not profess to be
exhaustive.</p>
<p>The subject-matter is divided into a number of rather short
chapters, dealing with the various classes and subdivisions into
which surnames fall; but the natural association which exists
between names has often prevailed over rigid classification. The
quotations by which obsolete words are illustrated are taken as
far as possible from Chaucer, whose writings date from the very
period when our surnames were gradually becoming hereditary. I
have also quoted extensively from the <i>Promptorium</i>
<i>Parvulorum</i>, our earliest English-Latin Dictionary
(1440).</p>
<p>In ch. vii, on Anglo-Saxon names, I have obtained some help
from a paper by the late Professor Skeat <i>(Transactions</i>
<i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Philological</i> <i>Society</i>, 1907-10,
pp. 57-85) and from the materials contained in Searle's valuable
<i>Onomasticon</i> <i>Anglo</i>-<i>Saxonicum</i> (Cambridge,
1897). Among several works which I have consulted on French and
German family names, the most useful have been Heintze's
<i>Deutsche</i> <i>Familiennamen</i>, 3rd ed. (Halle a. S., 1908)
and Kremers' <i>Beitraege</i> <i>zur</i> <i>Erforschung</i>
<i>der</i> <i>franzoesischen</i> <i>Familiennamen</i> (Bonn,
1910). The comparative method which I have adopted, especially in
explaining nicknames (ch. xxi), will be found, I think, to clear
up a good many dark points. Of books on names published in this
country, only Bardsley's <i>Dictionary</i> has been of any
considerable assistance, though I have gleaned some scraps of
information here and there from other compilations. My real
sources have been the lists of medieval names found in Domesday
Book, the Pipe Rolls, the Hundred Rolls, and in the numerous
historical records published by the Government and by various
antiquarian societies.</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The study of the origin of
family names is at the same time quite simple and very difficult.
Its simplicity consists in the fact that surnames can only come
into existence in certain well-understood ways. Its difficulty is
due to the extraordinary perversions which names undergo in
common speech, to the orthographic uncertainty of our ancestors,
to the frequent coalescence of two or more names of quite
different Origin, and to the multitudinous forms which one single
name can assume, such forms being due to local pronunciation,
accidents of spelling, date of adoption, and many minor causes.
It must always remembered that the majority of our surnames from
the various dialects of Middle English, <i>i.e</i>. of a language
very different from our own in spelling and sound, full of words
that are now obsolete, and of others which have completely
changed their form and meaning.</font></p>
<p>If we take any medieval roll of names, we see almost at a
glance that four such individuals as&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 10em">
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">John <i>filius</i>

Richard <i>le</i> <i>Spicer</i><br>
Robert <i>le</i> <i>Long</i><br>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">exhaust the possibilities of
English name-making&mdash;i.e. that every surname must be (i)
personal, from a sire or ancestor, (ii) local, from place of
residence, <i>[Footnote:</i> This is by far the largest class,
counting by names, not individuals, and many names for which I
give another explanation have also a local origin. Thus, when I
say that <i>Ely</i> is Old Fr. &Eacute;lie, <i>i.e</i>. Elias, I
assume that the reader will know without being told that it has
an alternative explanation from Ely in Cambridgeshire.<i>]</i>
(iii) occupative, from trade or office, (iv) a nickname, from
bodily attributes, character, etc.</font></p>
<p>This can easily be illustrated from any list of names taken at
random. The Rugby team chosen to represent the East Midlands
against Kent (January <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">22,</font> <font face="Bookman Old Style">1913) consisted of
the following fifteen names: <i>Hancock;</i> <i>Mobbs</i>,
<i>Poulton</i>, <i>Hudson</i>, <i>Cook;</i> <i>Watson</i>,
<i>Earl;</i> <i>Bull</i>, <i>Muddiman</i>, <i>Collins</i>,
<i>Tebbitt</i>, <i>Lacey</i>, <i>Hall</i>, <i>Osborne</i>,
<i>Manton</i>. Some of these are simple, but others require a
little knowledge for their explanation.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80701" id="Toc80701">PERSONAL NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>There are seven personal names, and the first of these,
<i>Hancock</i>, is rather a problem. This is usually explained as
from Flemish <i>Hanke</i>, Johnny, while the origin of the suffix
-<i>cock</i> has never been very clearly accounted for (see The
suffix &ndash;<i>cock</i>, Chapter VI). With <i>Hancock</i> we
may compare <i>Hankin</i>. But, while the Flemish derivation is
possible for these two names, it will not explain <i>Hanson</i>,
which sometimes becomes <i>Hansom</i> (Epithesis And
Assimilation, Chapter III). According to Camden, there is
evidence that <i>Han</i> was also used as a rimed form of
<i>Ran</i>, short for Ranolf and Randolf (cf. Hob from Robert,
Hick from Richard), very popular names in the north during the
surname period. In <i>Hankin</i> and <i>Hancock</i> this
<i>Han</i> would naturally coalesce with the Flemish
<i>Hanke</i>. This would also explain the <font face=
"Bookman Old Style" size="3">names</font> <i><font face=
"Bookman Old Style">Hand</font> for</i> Rand, and <i>Hands</i>,
<i>Hance</i> for <i>Rands</i>, <i>Rance</i>. <i>Mobbs</i>
<i>is</i> the same as <i>Mabbs</i> (cf. Moggy for Maggy), and
<i>Mabbs</i> <i>is</i> the genitive of Mab, <i>i.e</i>. Mabel,
for Amabel. We have the diminutive in <i>Mappin</i> and the
patronymic in <i>Mapleson</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Maple</i> and
<i>Mapple</i>, generally tree names (Chapter XII), are in some
cases for Mabel. <i>Maplethorpe</i> <i>is</i> from Mablethorpe
(Line.), thorp of Madalbert (Maethelbeorht).<i>]</i>
<i>Hudson</i> <i>is</i> the son of Hud, a very common medieval
name, which seems to represent Anglo-Saxon Hudda (Chapter VII),
the vigorous survival of which into the surname period is a
mystery. <i>Watson</i> is the son of <i>Wat</i>, <i>i.e</i>.
Walter, from the Old N.E. Fr. Vautier (Gautier), regularly
pronounced and written Water at one time&mdash;</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Hence the name <i>Waters</i>,
which has not usually any connection with water; while
<i>Waterman</i>, though sometimes</font> <font face=
"Bookman Old Style">occupative, is also formed from Walter, like
<i>Hickman</i> from Hick (Chapter VI). <i>Collins</i> <i>is</i>
from Colin, a French diminutive of Col, <i>i.e</i>. Nicol or
Nicolas.</font></p>
<p><i>Tebbitt</i> <i>is</i> a diminutive of Theobald, a favourite
medieval name which had the shortened forms <i>Teb</i>,
<i>Tib</i>, <i>Tub</i>, whence a number of derivatives. But names
in <i>Teb-</i> and <i>Tib-</i> may also come from Isabel (Chapter
X). <i>Osborne</i> is the Anglo-Saxon name Osbeorn.</p>
<p>Of course, each of these personal names has a meaning, e.g.
Amabel, ultimately Latin, means lovable, and Walter, a Germanic
name, means "rule army" (Modern Ger. <i>walten</i> and
<i>Heer)</i>, but the discussion of such meanings lies outside
our subject. It is, in fact, sometimes difficult to distinguish
between the personal name and the nickname. Thus <i>Pagan</i>,
whence Payn, with its diminutives <i>Pannell</i>, <i>Pennell</i>,
etc., <i>Gold</i>, <i>Good</i>, <i>German</i>, whence
<i>Jermyn</i>, <i>Jarman</i>, and many other apparent nicknames,
occur as personal names in the earliest records. Their
etymological origin is in any case the same as if they were
nicknames.</p>
<p>To return to our football team, <i>Poulton</i>, <i>Lacey</i>,
<i>Hall</i>, and <i>Manton</i> are local. There are several
villages in Cheshire and Lancashire named <i>Poulton</i>,
<i>i.e</i>. the town or homestead (Chapter XIII) by the pool.
<i>Lacey</i> occurs in <i>Domesday</i> <i>Book</i> as <i>de</i>
<i>Laci</i>, from some small spot in Normandy, probably the
hamlet of Lassy (Calvados). <i>Hall</i> <i>is</i> due to
residence near the great house of the neighbourhood. If Hall's
ancestor's name had chanced to be put down in Anglo-French as
<i>de</i> <i>la</i> <i>sale</i>, he might now be known as
<i>Sale</i>, or even as <i>Saul</i>. <i>Manton</i> <i>is</i> the
name of places in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, so that this
player, at any rate, has an ancestral qualification for the East
Midlands.</p>
<p>The only true occupative name in the list is <i>Cook</i>, for
<i>Earl</i> <i>is</i> a nickname. <i>Cook</i> was perhaps the
last occupative title to hold its own against the inherited name.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80702" id="Toc80702">NICKNAMES</a></b></p>
<p>The nicknames are <i>Earl</i>, <i>Bull</i>, and
<i>Muddiman</i>. Nicknames such as <i>Earl</i> may have been
acquired in various ways (Chapter XV). <i>Bull</i> and
<i>Muddiman</i> are singularly appropriate for Rugby scrummagers,
though the first may be from an inn or shop sign, rather than
from physique or character. It is equivalent to <i>Thoreau</i>,
Old Fr. <i>toreau</i> <i>(taureau)</i>. <i>Muddiman</i> <i>is</i>
for <i>Moodyman</i>, where moody has its older meaning of
valiant; cf. its German cognate <i>mutig</i>. The weather on the
day in question gave a certain fitness both to the original
meaning and the later form.</p>
<p>The above names are, with the exception of <i>Hancock</i>,
<i>Hudson</i>, and <i>Muddiman</i>, easy to solve; but it must
not be concluded that every list is as simple, or that the
obvious is always right. The first page of Bards
<i>Dictionary</i> <i>of</i> <i>Surnames</i> might well serve as a
danger-signal to cocksure writers on this subject. The names
<i>Abbey</i> and <i>Abbott</i> would naturally seem to go back to
an ancestor who lived in or near an and to another who had been
nicknamed the abbot.</p>
<p>But <i>Abbey</i> <i>is</i> more often from the Anglo-French
entry <i>le</i> <i>abb&eacute;</i>, the abbot, and <i>Abbott</i>
may be a diminutive of Ab, standing for Abel, or Abraham, the
first of which was a common medieval font-name. Francis
<i>Holyoak</i> describes himself on the title-page of his Latin
Dictionary (1612) as Franciscus <i>de</i> <i>Sacra</i>
<i>Quercu</i>, but his name also represents the holly oak, or
holm oak (Tree Names, Chapter XII). On the other hand,
<i>Holliman</i> always occurs in early rolls as <i>hali</i>
<i>or</i> <i>holi</i> <i>man</i>, <i>i.e</i>. holy man.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80703" id="Toc80703">MYTHICAL
ETYMOLOGIES</a></b></p>
<p>It may be stated here, once for all, that etymologies of names
which are based on medieval latinizations, family mottoes, etc.,
are always to be regarded with suspicion, as they involve the
reversing of chronology, or the explanation of a name by a pun
which has been made from it. We find <i>Lilburne</i> latinized as
<i>de</i> <i>insula</i> <i>tontis</i>, as though it were the
impossible hybrid <i>de</i> <i>l'isle</i> <i>burn</i>, and
<i>Beautoy</i> sometimes as <i>de</i> <i>bella</i> <i>fide</i>,
whereas <i>foy</i> <i>is</i> the Old French for beech, from Lat.
<i>fagus</i>. <i>Napier</i> of Merchiston had the motto
<i>n'a</i> <i>pier</i>, <i>"</i>has no equal," and described
himself on title-pages as the Nonpareil, but his ancestor was a
servant who looked after the napery. With Holyoak's rendering of
his own name we may compare Parkinson's "latinization" of his
name in his famous book on gardening(1629), which bears the title
<i>Paradisi</i> <i>in</i> <i>Sole</i> <i>Paradisus</i>
<i>Terrest</i>ris, <i>i.e</i>. the Earthly Paradise of "Park in
Sun."</p>
<p>Many noble names have an anecdotic "explanation." I learnt at
school that <i>Percy</i> came from "pierce-eye," in allusion to a
treacherous exploit at Alnwick. The <i>Lesleys</i> claim descent
from a hero who overthrew a Hungarian champion</p>

that the original <i>Lockhart</i> took the "heart" of the Bruce
to the Holy Land in a "locked" casket. Practically every famous
Scottish name has a yarn connected with it, the gem perhaps being
that which accounts for <i>Guthrie</i>. A Scottish king, it is
said, landed weary and hungry as the sole survivor of a
shipwreck. He approached a woman who was gutting fish, and asked
her to prepare one for him. The kindly fishwife at once replied,
"I'll gut three." Whereupon the king, dropping into rime with a
readiness worthy of Mr. Wegg, said&mdash;</font></p>

<p>After all, truth is stranger than fiction. There is quite
enough legitimate cause for wonderment in the fact that

<i>Douch</i>, or that <i>Strangeways</i>, from a district in
Manchester which, lying between the Irwell and the Irk, formerly
subject to floods, is etymologically <i>strong</i>-<i>wash</i>.
The Joannes <i>Acutus</i> whose tomb stands in Florence is the
great free-lance captain Sir John <i>Hawkwood</i>, "omitting the

freemasonry, who turned out to be Pythagoras.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80704" id="Toc80704">ALTERNATIVE
ORIGINS</a></b></p>
<p>Many names are susceptible of two, three, or more
explanations. This is especially true of some of our commonest
monosyllabic surnames. <i>Bell</i> may be from Anglo-Fr.
<i>le</i> <i>bel</i> <i>(beau)</i>, or from a shop sign, or from
residence near the church or town bell. It may even have been
applied to the man who pulled the bell. Finally, the ancestor may
have been a lady called Isabel, a supposition which does not
necessarily imply illegitimacy (Chapter X). <i>Ball</i> <i>is</i>
sometimes the shortened form of the once favourite Baldwin. It is
also from a shop sign, and perhaps most frequently of all is for
<i>bald</i>. The latter word is properly <i>balled</i>,
<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., marked with a <i>ball</i>, or white streak, a
word of Celtic origin; cf. "piebald," <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.,
<i>balled</i> like a (mag)pie, and the "bald-faced stag."
<i>[Footnote:</i> Halliwell notes that the nickname <i>Ball</i>
<i>is</i> the name of a horse in Chaucer and in Tusser, of a
sheep in the <i>Promptorium</i> <i>Parvulorum</i>, and of a dog
in the Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VIII. In each case the name
alludes to a white mark, or what horsy people call a star. A cow
thus marked is called in Scotland a <i>boasand</i> <i>cow</i>,
and from the same word comes the obsolete <i>bawson</i>,
badger.<i>]</i> From the same word we get the augmentative
<i>Ballard</i>, used, according to Wyclif, by the little boys who
unwisely called to an irritable prophet&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">"Stey up
<i>ballard"</i> (2 Kings ii. 23).</font></p>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The name may also be personal,
Anglo-Sax. Beal-heard. <i>Rowe</i> may be local, from residence
in a row (cf. Fr. <i>Delarue)</i>, or it may be an accidental
spelling of the nickname <i>Roe</i>, which also survives in the
Mid. English form <i>Ray</i> (Beasts, Chapter XXIII).</font></p>
<p>But <i>Row</i> was also the shortened form of Rowland, or
Roland. <i>Cobb</i> <i>is</i> an Anglo-Saxon name, as in the
local Cobham, but it is also from the first syllable of
<i>Cobbold</i> (for either Cuthbeald or Godbeald) and the second
of Jacob. From Jacob come the diminutives <i>Cobbin</i> and
Coppin.</p>
<p>Or, to take some less common names, <i>House</i> not only
represents the medieval <i>de</i> <i>la</i> <i>house</i>, but
also stands for <i>Howes</i>, which, in its turn, may be the
plural of <i>how</i>, a <i>hill</i> (Chapter XII), or the
genitive of <i>How</i>, one of the numerous medieval forms of
Hugh (Chapter VI). <i>Hind</i> may be for <i>Hine</i>, a farm
servant (Chapter III), or for Mid. Eng. <i>hende</i>, courteous
(cf. for the vowel change <i>Ind</i>, Chapter XIII), and is
perhaps sometimes also an animal nickname (Beasts, Chapter
XXIII). <i>Rouse</i> <i>is</i> generally Fr. roux, <i>i.e</i>.
the red, but it may also be the nominative form of Rou,
<i>i.e</i>. of Rolf, or Rollo, the sea-king who conquered
Normandy. <i>[Footnote:</i> Old French had a declension in two
cases. The nominative, which has now almost disappeared, was
usually distinguished by -<i>s</i>. This survives in a few words,
e.g. <i>fils</i>, and proper names such as <i>Charles</i>,
<i>Jules</i>, <i>etc]</i> <i>Was</i> <i>Holman</i> the holy man,
the man who lived near a <i>holm</i>, <i>i.e</i>. holly (Chapter
XII), on a <i>holm</i>, or river island (Chapter XII), or in a
<i>hole</i>, or hollow? All these origins have equal claims.</p>
<p>As a rule, when an apparent nickname is also susceptible of
another solution, baptismal, local, or occupative, the
alternative explanation is to be preferred, as the popular
tendency has always been towards twisting names into significant
words. Thus, to take an example of each class, <i>Diamond</i> is
sometimes for an old name Daymond (Daegmund), <i>Portwine</i> is
a corruption of Poitevin, the man from Poitou (Chapter XI), and
<i>Tipler</i>, which now suggests alcoholic excess, was, as late
as the seventeenth century, the regular name for an alehouse
keeper.</p>

for the modern bearer of a name. Any <i>Boon</i> or <i>Bone</i>

"lastbookmark1"></a>(Alternative Origins, Chapter I), which also
survives in <i>Pears</i> and <i>Pearson</i>. <i>Swain</i> may go
back to the father of Canute, or to some hoary-headed swain who,
possibly, tended the swine. Not all the <i>Seymours</i> are
<i>St. Maurs</i>. Some of them were once <i>Seamers</i>,
<i>i.e</i>. tailors. <i>Gosling</i> <i>is</i> rather trivial, but
it represents the romantic Jocelyn, in Normandy Gosselin, a
diminutive of the once very popular personal name Josse.
<i>Goss</i> is usually for goose, but any <i>Goss</i>, or
<i>Gossett</i>, unwilling to trace his family back to John
<i>Goose</i>, "my lord of Yorkes fole," <i>[Footnote:</i> Privy
Purse Expenses of Elizabeth of York (1502).<i>]</i> may likewise
choose the French Josse or Gosse. <i>Goss</i> may also be a
dialect pronunciation of gorse, the older form of which has given
the name <i>Gorst</i>. <i>Coward</i>, though humble, cow-herd, is
no more timid than <i>Craven</i>, the name of a district in the
West Riding of Yorkshire.</font></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Chucks</i>, when in good society, "seldom bowed, Sir,
to anything under <i>three</i> syllables" <i>(Peter</i>
<i>Simple</i>, ch. xvii.). But the length of a name is not
necessarily an index of a noble meaning. As will be seen (pp. 74,
5), a great number of our monosyllabic names belong to, the
oldest stratum of all. The boatswain's own name, from Norman-Fr.
<i>chouque</i>, a tree-stump, is identical with the rather
aristocratic <i>Zouch</i> or <i>Such</i>, from the usual French
form <i>souche</i>. <i>Stubbs</i>, which has the same meaning,
may be compared with <i>Curson</i>, <i>Curzon</i>, Fr.
<i>courson</i>, a stump, a derivative of <i>court</i>, short.
<i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Curson</i> <i>is</i> also a dialect variant
of <i>Christian</i>.<i>]</i> <i>Pomeroy</i> has a lordly ring,
but is the Old French for <i>Applegarth</i> or <i>Appleyard</i>

by novelists and young ladies to be aristocratic; why so is a
puzzle; as its plain meaning is a tenant farmer and nothing more
or less" <i>(Two</i> <i>Years</i> <i>Ago</i>, ch.
xi.).</font></p>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The word is said to represent a
Vulgar Lat. <i>vassus</i> <i>vassorum</i>, vassal of
vassals.</font></p>
<p>On the other hand, many a homely name has a complimentary
meaning. Mr. Wegg did not like the name <i>Boffin</i>, but its
oldest form is <i>bon</i>-<i>fin</i>, good and fine. In 1273 Mr.
<i>Bumble's</i> name was spelt <i>bon</i>-<i>bel</i>, good and
beautiful. With these we may group <i>Bunker</i>, of which the
oldest form is <i>bon</i>-<i>quer</i> <i>(bon</i> <i>coeur)</i>,
and <i>Boffey</i>, which corresponds to the common French name
<i>Bonnefoy</i>, good faith; while the much more assertive
Beaufoy means simply fine beech (Chapter I).</p>
<p>With <i>Bunker</i> we may compare <i>Goodhart</i> and
<i>Cordeaux</i>, the oldest form of the latter being the French
name <i>Courdoux</i>. <i>Momerie</i> and <i>Mummery</i> are
identical with <i>Mowbray</i>, from Monbrai in Normandy.
<i>Molyneux</i> impresses more than <i>Mullins</i>, of which it
is merely the dim., Fr. <i>moulins</i>, mills. The Yorkshire name
<i>Tankard</i> is identical with Tancred. <i>Stiggins</i> goes
back to the illustrious Anglo-Saxon name Stigand, as
<i>Wiggins</i> does to <i>wigand</i>, a champion. <i>Cadman</i>
represents Caedmon, the name of the poet-monk of Whitby.
<i>Segar</i> is an imitative form of the Anglo-Sax. Saegaer, of
which the normal modern representative is <i>Sayers</i>.
<i>Giblett</i> is not a name one would covet, but it stands in
the same relationship to Gilbert as <i>Hamlet</i> does to
Hamo.</p>
<p>A small difference in spelling makes a great difference in the
look of a name. The aristocratic <i>Coke</i> is an archaic
spelling of <i>Cook</i>, the still more lordly <i>Herries</i>
sometimes disguises <i>Harris</i>, while the modern
<i>Brassey</i> is the same as de Bracy in <i>Ivanhoe</i>. The
rather grisly <i>Nightgall</i> is a variant of
<i>Nightingale</i>. The accidental retention of particles and
articles is also effective, e.g. <i>Delmar</i>, <i>Delamere</i>,
<i>Delapole</i>, impress more than <i>Mears</i> and <i>Pool</i>,
and <i>Larpent</i> (Fr. I'arpent), <i>Lemaitre</i>, and
<i>Lestrange</i> more than <i>Acres</i>, <i>Masters</i>, and
<i>Strange</i>. There are few names of less heroic sound than
<i>Spark</i> and <i>Codlin</i>, yet the former is sometimes a
contraction of the picturesque Sparrow-hawk, used as a personal
name by the Anglo-Saxons, while the latter can be traced back
<i>via</i> the earlier forms <i>Quodling</i> (still found),
Querdling, Querdelyoun to Coeur de Lion.</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Just as, in studying a new
language, the linguist finds it most helpful to take a simple
text and hammer out in</font> <font face=
"Bookman Old Style">detail every word and grammatical form it
contains, so the student of name-lore cannot do better than
tackle a medieval roll and try to connect every name in it with
those of the present day. I give here two lists of names from the
Hundred Rolls of 1273. The first contains the names of London and
Middlesex jurymen, most of them, especially the Londoners, men of
substance and position. The second is a list of cottagers
resident in the village of Steeple Claydon in Bucks. Even a
cursory perusal of these lists should Suffice to dispel all
recollection of the nightmare "philology" which has been so much
employed to obscure what is perfectly simple and obvious; while a
very slight knowledge of Latin and French is all that is required
to connect these names of men who were dead and buried before the
Battle of Crecy with those to</font> <font face=
"Bookman Old Style">be found in any modern directory. The brief
indications supplied under each name will be found in a fuller
form in the various chapters of the book to which references are
given.</font></p>
<p>For simplicity I have given the modern English form of each
Christian name and expanded the abbreviations used by the
official compilers. It will be noticed that English, Latin, and
Anglo-French are used indifferently, that <i>le</i> is usually,
though not always, put before the trade-name or nickname, that
<i>de</i> <i>is</i> put before place-names and <i>at</i> before
spots which have no proper name. The names in the right-hand
column are only specimens of the, often very numerous, modern
equivalents.</p>

<p>The above lists illustrate all the simpler ways in which
surnames could be formed. At the time of compilation they were
not hereditary. Thus the last man on the list is Simon
<i>Johnson</i>, but his father was John <i>Neilson</i>, or
<i>Nelson</i> (Chapter X), and his son would be &mdash;
<i>Simpson</i>, <i>Sims</i>, etc. This would go on until, at a
period varying with the locality, the wealth and importance of
the individual, one name in the line would become accidentally
petrified and persist to the present day. The chain could, of
course, be broken at any time by the assumption of a name from
one of the other three classes (Chapter I).</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Many people are particular
about the spelling of their names. I am myself, although, as a
student of philology, I ought to know better. The greatest of
Englishmen was so careless in the matter as to sign himself
<i>Shakspe</i>, a fact usually emphasized by Baconian when
speaking of the illiterate clown of Stratford-on-Avon. Equally
illiterate must have been the learned Dr. Crown, who, in the
various books he published in the latter half of the seventeenth
century, spelt his name, indifferently Cron, Croon, Croun, Crone,
Croone, Croune. The modern spelling of any particular name Is a
pure accident. Before the Elementary Education Act of 1870 a
considerable proportion of English people did not spell their
names at all. They trusted to the parson and the clerk, who did
their best with unfamiliar names. Even now old people in rural
districts may find half a dozen orthographic variants of their
own names among the sparse documentary records of their lives.
Dugdale the antiquary is said to have found more than 130
variants of <i>Mainwaring</i> among the parchments of that
family. Bardsley quotes, under the name
<i>Blenkinsop</i>&mdash;</font></p>

VARIANT SPELLINGS</a></b></p>
<p>Medieval spelling was roughly phonetic, <i>i.e</i>. it
attempted to reproduce the sound of the period and region, and
even men of learning, as late as the eighteenth century, were
very uncertain in matters of orthography. The spelling of the
language is now practically normalized, although in conformity
with no sort of principle; but the family name, as a private
possession, has kept its freedom. Thus, if we wish to speak
poetically of a meadow, I suppose we should call it a <i>lea</i>,
but the same word is represented by the family names <i>Lea</i>,
<i>Lee</i>, <i>Ley</i>, <i>Leigh</i>, <i>Legh</i>, <i>Legge</i>,
<i>Lay</i>, <i>Lye</i>, perhaps the largest group of local
surnames we possess.</p>
<p>In matters of spelling we observe various tendencies. One is
the retention of an archaic form, which does not necessarily
affect pronunciation. Late Mid. English was fond of <i>y</i> for
<i>i</i>, of double consonants, and of final -<i>e</i>. All these
appear in the names <i>Thynne</i> (thin) and <i>Wyllie</i>
<i>(wily)</i>. Therefore we should not deride the man who writes
himself <i>Smythe</i>. But in some cases the pronunciation
suffers, e.g. the name <i>Fry</i> represents Mid. Eng.
<i>fri</i>, one of the forms of the adjective that is now written
<i>free</i>. <i>Burt</i> represents Anglo-Sax. <i>beorht</i>, the
normal result of which is <i>Bright</i>. We now write
<i>subtle</i> and <i>perfect</i>, artificial words, in the second
of which the pronunciation has been changed in accordance with
the restored spelling; but the older forms survive <font face=
"Bookman Old Style" size="3">in</font> <font face=
"Bookman Old Style">the names <i>Suttle</i> and
<i>Parfitt</i>&mdash;</font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">

<p>(A, 72.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The usual English pronunciation
of names like <i>Mackenzie</i>, <i>Menzies</i>, <i>Dalziel</i>,
is due to the substitution by the printer of a <i>z</i> for an
obsolete letter that represented a soft palatal sound more like
<i>y</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> This substitution has led one writer
on surnames, who apparently confuses bells with beans, to derive
the rare surname <i>Billiter</i>, whence Billiter's Lane in the
City, from "<i>Belzetter</i>, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., the
<i>Bell</i>-<i>setter</i>.<i>"</i> The Mid. Eng.
"<i>bellezeter</i>, campanarius" <i>(Prompt</i>.

<p>We have an archaic plural ending in <i>Knollys</i>
<i>(Knowles)</i>, the plural of knoll, and in <i>Sandys</i>, and
an archaic spelling <i>in</i> <i>Sclater</i> for <i>Slater</i> or
<i>Slatter</i>, for both slat and slate come from Old Fr.
<i>esclat</i> <i>(&eacute;clat)</i>, a splinter. With
<i>Knollys</i> and <i>Sandys</i> we may put <i>Pepys</i>, for the
existence of the dims. <i>Pipkin</i>, <i>Peppitt</i>, and
<i>Peppiatt</i> points to the medieval name Pipun, corresponding
to the royal Pepin. <i>Streatfeild</i> preserves variant
spellings of street and field. In <i>Gardiner</i> we have the Old
Northern French word which now, as a common noun, gardener, is
assimilated to garden, the normal French form of which appears in
<i>Jardine</i>.</p>
<p>Such orthographic variants as <i>i</i> and <i>y</i>,
<i>Simons</i>, <i>Symons</i>, <i>Ph</i> and <i>f</i>,
<i>Jephcott</i>, <i>Jeffcott</i>, <i>s</i> and <i>c</i>,
<i>Pearce</i>, <i>Pearce</i>, <i>Rees</i>, <i>Reece</i>,
<i>Sellars</i> (cellars), <i>ks</i> and <i>x</i>, <i>Dickson</i>,
<i>Dixon</i>, are a matter of taste or accident. Initial letters
which became mute often disappeared in spelling, e.g.
<i>Wray</i>, a corner (Chapter XIII), has become hopelessly
confused with <i>Ray</i>, a roe, <i>Knott</i>, from Cnut,
<i>i.e</i>. Canute, or from dialect <i>knot</i>, a hillock, with
<i>Noll</i>, crop-haired. <i>Knowlson</i> is the son of
<i>Nowell</i> (Chapter IX) or of Noll, <i>i.e</i>. Oliver.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Mr. X. asserts that his name has always been
spelt in such and such a way, he is talking nonsense. If his
great-grandfather's will is accessible, he will probably find two
or three variants in that alone. The great Duke of Wellington, as
a younger man, signed himself Arthur Wesley&mdash;</p>

<p>The telescoping of long names is a familiar phenomenon.

<i>Stepson</i> is for Stevenson. It is this tendency which makes
the connection between surnames and village names so difficult to
establish in many cases, for the artificial name as it occurs in

<p><b><a name="Toc80712" id="Toc80712">DIALECTIC
VARIANTS</a></b></p>
<p>Dialectic variants must also be taken into account. Briggs and
Rigg represent the Northern forms of Bridges and Ridge, and
Philbrick is a disguised Fellbrigg. In Egg we have rather the
survival of the Mid. English spelling of Edge. Braid, Lang,
Strang, are Northern variants of Broad, Long, Strong. Auld is for
Old while <i>Tamson</i> is for Thompson and <i>Dabbs</i> for
Dobbs (Robert). We have the same change of vowel in Raper, for
Roper. Venner generally means hunter, Fr. <i>veneur</i>, but
sometimes represents the West-country form of Fenner, the
fen-dweller; cf. Vidler for fiddler, and Vanner for Fanner, the
winnower.</p>
<p>We all the difficulty we have in catching a new and unfamiliar
name, and the subterfuges we employ to find out what it really
is. In such cases we do not get the help from association and
analogy which serves us in dealing with language in general, but
find ourselves in the position of a foreigner or child hearing
unfamiliar word for the first time. We realize how many
imperceptible shades there are between a short <i>i</i> and a
short <i>e</i>, or between a fully voiced <i>g</i> and a
voiceless <i><font face="Bookman Old Style">k</font>, examples
suggested to me by my having lately understood a Mr. Riggs to be
a Mr. Rex.</i></p>
<p>We find occurring in surnames examples of those consonantal
changes which do not violate the great Phonetic law that such
changes can only occur regularly within the same group,
<i>i.e</i>. that a labial cannot alternate with a palatal, or a
dental with either. It is thus that we find <i>b</i> alternating
with <i>p</i>, <i>Hobbs</i> and <i>Hopps</i> (Robert),
<i>Bollinger</i> and <i>Pullinger</i>, Fr. <i>boulanger;</i>
<i>g</i> with <i>k</i>, <i>Cutlack</i> and <i>Goodlake</i>
(Anglo-Sax. Guthlac), <i>Diggs</i> and <i>Dix</i> (Richard),
<i>Gipps</i> and <i>Kipps</i> (Gilbert), <i>Catlin</i> and
<i>Galling</i> (Catherine); <i>j</i> with <i>ch</i>, <i>Jubb</i>
<i>or</i> <i>Jupp</i> and <i>Chubb</i> (Job); <i>d</i>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">with <i>t</i>, <i>Proud</i> and
<i>Prout</i> (Chapter XXII), <i>Dyson</i> and <i>Tyson</i>
(Dionisia), and also with <i>th</i>, <i>Carrodus</i> and
<i>Carruthers</i> (a hamlet in Dumfries). The alternation of
<i>c</i> and <i>ch</i> or <i>g</i> and <i>j</i> in names of
French origin is dialectic, the <i>c</i> and <i>g</i>
representing the Norman-Picard pronunciation, e.g. <i>Campion</i>
for <i>Champion</i>, <i>Gosling</i> for <i>Joslin</i>. In some
cases we have shown a definite preference for one form, e.g.
<i>Chancellor</i> and <i>Chappell</i>, but <i>Carpenter</i> and
<i>Camp</i>. In English names <i>c</i> is northern, <i>ch</i>
southern, e.g. <i>Carlton</i>, <i>Charlton</i>, <i>Kirk</i>,
<i>Church</i>.</font></p>
<p>There are also a few very common vowel changes. The sound
<i>er</i> <i>usually</i> became <i>ar</i>, as in <i>Barclay</i>
(Berkeley), <i>Clark</i>, <i>Darby</i>, <i>Garrard</i> (Gerard),
<i>Jarrold</i> (Gerald), <i>Harbord</i> (Herbert), <i>Jarvis</i>
(Gervase), <i>Marchant</i>, <i>Sargent</i>, etc., while
<i>Larned</i>, our great-grandfathers' pronunciation of
"learned," corresponds to Fr. <i>Littri</i>. Thus <i>Parkins</i>
<i>is</i> the same name as <i>Perkins</i>. (Peter), and these
also give <i>Parks</i> and <i>Perks</i>, the former of which is
usually not connected with <i>Park</i>. <i>To</i> Peter, or
rather to Fr. Pierre, belong also <i>Parr</i>, <i>Parry</i> and
<i>Perry</i>, though <i>Parry</i> <i>is</i> generally Welsh
(Chapter VI). The dims. <i>Parrott</i>, <i>Perrott</i>, etc.,
were sometimes nicknames, the etymology being the same, for our
word <i>parrot</i> is from Fr. <i>pierrot</i>. <i>To</i> the
freedom with which this sound is spelt, e.g. <i>in</i>
<i>Herd</i>, <i>Heard</i>, <i>Hird</i>, <i>Hurd</i>, we also owe
<i>Purkiss</i> for <i>Perkins;</i> cf. <i>appurtenance</i> for
<i>appartenance</i>.</p>
<p>The letter <i>l</i> seems also to exercise a demoralizing
influence on the adjacent vowel. Juliana became Gillian, and from
this, or from the masculine form Julian, we get <i>Jalland</i>,
<i>Jolland</i>, and the shortened <i>Gell</i>, <i>Gill</i>
(Chapter VI), and <i>Jull</i>. <i>Gallon</i>, which Bardsley
groups with these, is more often a French name, from the Old
German Walo, or a corruption of the still commoner French name
<i>Galland</i>, likewise of Germanic origin.</p>
<p>We find also such irregular vowel changes as <i>Flinders</i>
for Flanders, and conversely <i>Packard</i> <i>for</i> Picard.
<i>Pottinger</i> (see below) sometimes becomes <i>Pettinger</i>
as Portugal gives <i>Pettingall</i>. The general tendency is
towards that thinning of the vowel that we get in <i>mister</i>
for <i>master</i> and Miss Miggs's <i>mim</i> for <i>ma'am</i>.
<i>Littimer</i> for <i>Lattimer</i> <i>is</i> an example of this.
But in <i>Royle</i> for the local <i>Ryle</i> we find the same
broadening which has given <i>boil</i>, a swelling, for earlier
<i>bile</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80713" id="Toc80713">APHESIS</a></b></p>
<p>Among phonetic changes which occur with more or less
regularity are those called aphesis, epenthesis, epithesis,
assimilation, dissimilation, and metathesis, convenient terms
which are less learned than they appear. Aphesis is the loss of
the unaccented first syllable, as in <i>'baccy</i> and
<i>'later</i>. It occurs almost regularly in words of French
origin, e.g. <i>squire</i> and <i>esquire</i>, <i>Prentice</i>
and <i>apprentice</i>. When such double forms exist, the surname
invariably assumes the popular form, e.g. <i>Prentice</i>,
<i>Squire</i>. Other examples are <i>Bonner</i>, <i>i.e</i>.
debonair, <i>Jenner</i>, <i>Jenoure</i>, for Mid. Eng.
<i>engenour</i>, engineer, <i>Cator</i>, <i>Chaytor</i>, Old Fr.
<i>acatour</i> <i>(acheteur)</i>, a buyer&mdash;</p>

<p><i><font face="Bookman Old Style">Spencer</font>, dispenser, a
spender, Stacey for Eustace, Vick and Veck for Levick, i.e.
l'&eacute;v&ecirc;que, the bishop, Pottinger for the obsolete
potigar, an apothecary, etc.</i></p>
<p>The institution now known as the "orspittle" was called by our
unlettered forefathers the "spital," hence the names
<i>Spittle</i> and <i>Spittlehouse</i>. A well-known amateur
goal-keeper has the appropriate name <i>Fender</i>, for
defender.</p>
<p>Many names beginning with <i>n</i> are due to aphesis, e.g.
<i>Nash</i> for <i>atten</i> <i>ash</i>, <i>Nalder</i>,
<i>Nelms</i>, <i>Nock</i>, <i>atten</i> <i>oak</i>, <i>Nokes</i>,
<i>Nye</i>, <i>atten</i> <i>ey</i>, at the island, <i>Nangle</i>,
<i>atten</i> <i>angle</i>, <i>Nind</i> or <i>Nend</i>,
<i>atten</i> <i>ind</i> or <i>end</i>. With these we may compare
<i>Twells</i>, <i>at</i> <i>wells</i>, and the numerous cases in
which the first part of a personal name is dropped, e.g.
<i>Tolley</i>, Bartholomew, <i>Munn</i>, Edmund, <i>Pott</i>,
Philpot, dim. of Philip (see p.87), and the less common
<i>Facey</i>, from Boniface, and <i>Loney</i>, from Apollonia,
the latter of which has also given <i>Applin</i>.</p>
<p>When a name compounded with Saint begins with a vowel, we get
such forms as <i>Tedman</i>, St. Edmund, <i>Tobin</i>, St. Aubyn,
<i>Toosey</i>, St. Osith, <i>Toomey</i>, St. Omer, <i>Tooley</i>,
St. Olave; cf. <i>Tooley</i> <i>St.</i> for St. Olave St. and
<i>tawdry</i> from St. Audrey. When the saint's name begins with
a consonant, we get, instead of aphesis, a telescoped
pronunciation, e.g. <i>Selinger</i>, St. Leger, <i>Seymour</i>,
St. Maur, <i>Sinclair</i>, St. Clair, <i>Semark</i>, St. Mark,
<i>Semple</i>, St. Paul, <i>Simper</i>, St. Pierre,
<i>Sidney</i>, probably for St. Denis, with which we may compare
the educated pronunciation of <i>St. John</i>. These names are
all of local origin, from chapelries in Normandy or England.</p>
<p>Epenthesis is the insertion of a sound which facilitates
pronunciation, such as that of <i>b</i> in Fr. <i>chambre</i>,
from Lat. <i>camera</i>. The intrusive sound may be a vowel or a
consonant, as in the names <i>Henery</i>, <i>Hendry</i>,
perversions of <i>Henry</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> On the usual fate
of this name in English, see below.<i>]</i></p>
<p><i>To</i> <i>Hendry</i> we owe the northern <i>Henderson</i>,
which has often coalesced with <i>Anderson</i>, from Andrew.
These are contracted into <i>Henson</i> and <i>Anson</i>, the
latter also from Ann and Agnes (Chapter IX). Intrusion of a vowel
is seen in <i>Greenaway</i>, <i>Hathaway</i>, heath way,
<i>Treadaway</i>, trade (i.e. trodden) way, etc., also in
<i>Horniman</i>, <i>Alabone</i>, Alban, <i>Minister</i>, minster,
<i>etc</i>. But epenthesis of a consonant is more common,
especially <i>b</i> or <i>p</i> after <i>m</i>, and <i>d</i>
after <i>n</i>. Examples are <i>Gamble</i> for the Anglo-Saxon
name Gamel, <i>Hamblin</i> for <i>Hamlin</i>, a double diminutive
of Hamo, <i>Simpson</i>, <i>Thompson</i>, etc., and
<i>Grindrod</i>, green royd (see p. III). There is also the
special case of <i>n</i> before <i>g</i> in such names as
<i>Firminger</i> (Chapter XV), <i>Massinger</i> (Chapter XX),
<i>Pottinger</i> (Chapter XVIII), etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80714" id="Toc80714">EPITHESIS AND
ASSIMILATION</a></b></p>
<p>Epithesis, or the addition of a final consonant, is common in
uneducated speech, e.g. <i>scholard</i>, <i>gownd</i>,
<i>garding</i>, etc. I say "uneducated," but many such forms have
been adapted by the language, e.g. <i>sound</i>, Fr. <i>son</i>,
and we have the name <i>Kitching</i> for kitchen. The usual
additions are -<i>d</i>, -<i>t</i>, or -<i>g</i> after <i>n</i>,
e.g. <i>Simmonds</i>, Simon, <i>Hammond</i>, <i>Hammant</i>, Fr.
Hamon, <i>Hind</i>, a farm labourer, of which the older form is
<i>Hine</i> (Chapter XVII), <i>Collings</i> for Collins,
<i>Jennings</i>, Fr. Jeannin, dim. of Jean, <i>Aveling</i> from
the female name Avelina or Evelyn. <i>Neill</i> <i>is</i> for
<i>Neil</i>, Nigel. We have epithetic -<i>b</i> in <i>Plumb</i>,
the man who lived by the plum-tree and epithetic -<i>p</i> in
<i>Crump</i> (Chapter II).</p>
<p>Assimilation is the tendency of a sound to imitate its
neighbour. Thus the <i>d</i> of <i>Hud</i> (Chapter I) sometimes
becomes <i>t</i> in contact with the sharp <i>s</i>, hence
<i>Hutson;</i> <i>Tomkins</i> tends to become <i>Tonkin</i>,
whence <i>Tonks</i>, if the <i>m</i> and <i>k</i> are not
separated by the epenthetic <i>p</i>, <i>Tompkins</i>. In
<i>Hopps</i> and <i>Hopkins</i> we have the <i>b</i> of Hob
assimilated to the sharp <i>s</i> and <i>k</i>, while in
<i>Hobbs</i> we pronounce a final -<i>z</i>. It is perhaps under
the influence of the initial labial that <i>Milson</i>, son of
Miles or Michael, sometimes becomes <i>Milsom</i>, and
<i>Branson</i>, son of Brand, appears as <i>Bransom</i>.</p>
<p>The same group of names is affected by dissimilation,
<i>i</i>.<i>e.</i> the instinct to avoid the recurrence of the
same sound. Thus <i>Ranson</i>, son of Ranolf or Randolf, becomes
<i>Ransom</i> <i>[Footnote:</i> So also Fr, <i>ran&ccedil;on</i>
gives Eng. <i>ransom</i>. The French surname <i>Ran&ccedil;on</i>
<i>is</i> probably aphetic for <i>Lauran&ccedil;on</i>.<i>]</i>
by dissimilation of one <i>n</i>, and <i>Hanson</i>, son of Han
(Chapter I), becomes <i>Hansom</i>. In <i>Sansom</i> we have
Samson assimilated to <i>Samson</i> and then dissimilated.
Dissimilation especially affects the sounds <i>l</i>, <i>n</i>,
<i>r</i>. <i>Bullivant</i> <i>is</i> found earlier as <i>bon</i>
<i>enfaunt</i> <i>(Goodchild)</i>, just as a braggart Burgundian
was called by Tudor dramatists a <i>burgullian.</i>
<i>Bellinger</i> <i>is</i> for <i>Barringer</i>, an Old French
name of Teutonic origin. <i>[Footnote:</i> "When was Bobadil
here, your captain? that rogue, that foist, that fencing
<i>burgullian"</i> (Jonson, <i>Every</i> <i>Man</i> <i>in</i>
<i>his</i> <i>Humour</i>, iv. 2).<i>]</i> Those people called
<i>Salisbury</i> who do not hail from Salesbury in Lancashire
must have had an ancestor <i>de</i> <i>Sares</i>-<i>bury</i>, for
such was the earlier name of Salisbury (Sarum). A number of
occupative names have lost the last syllable by dissimilation,
e.g. <i>Pepper</i> for pepperer, <i>Armour</i> for armourer. For
further examples see Chapter XV.</p>
<p>It may be noted here that, apart from dissimilation, the
sounds <i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, have a general tendency to
become confused, e.g. <i>Phillimore</i> <i>is</i> for Finamour
<i>(Dearlove)</i>, which also appears as <i>Finnemore</i> and
<i>Fenimore</i>, the latter also to be explained from fen and
moor. <i>Catlin</i> <i>is</i> from Catherine. <i>Balestier</i>, a
cross-bow man, gives <i>Bannister</i>, and <i>Hamnet</i> and
<i>Hamlet</i> both occur as the name of one of Shakespeare's
sons. Janico or Jenico, Fr. Janicot may be the origin of
<i>Jellicoe</i>.</p>
<p>We also get the change of <i>r</i> to <i>l</i> in Hal, for
Harry, whence <i>Hallett</i>, <i>Hawkins</i> (Halkins), and the
Cornish <i>Hockin</i>, Mal or Mol for Mary, whence
<i>Malleson</i>, <i>Mollison</i>, etc., and <i>Pell</i> for
Peregrine. This confusion is common in infantile speech, e.g. I
have heard a small child express great satisfaction at the
presence on the table of "blackbelly dam."</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80715" id="Toc80715">METATHESIS</a></b></p>
<p>Metathesis, or the transposition of sound, chiefly
<i>affects</i> <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>, especially the latter. Our
word cress is from Mid. Eng. <i>kers</i>, which appears in
<i>Karslake</i>, <i>Toulmin</i> <i>is</i> for <i>Tomlin</i>, a
double dim., -<i>el</i>-<i>in</i>, of Tom, <i>Grundy</i>
<i>is</i> for <i>Gundry</i>, from Anglo-Sax. Gundred, and Joe
<i>Gargery</i> descended from a <i>Gregory</i>. <i>Burnell</i> is
for <i>Brunel</i>, dim. of Fr. <i>brun</i>, brown, and
<i>Thrupp</i> <i>is</i> for <i>Thorp</i>, a village (Chapter
XIII). <i>Strickland</i> was formerly Stirkland, <i>Cripps</i>
<i>is</i> the same as <i>Crisp</i>, from Mid. Eng. <i>crisp</i>,
curly. Prentis Jankin had&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Both names may also be short
for Crispin, the etymology being the same in any case. Apps is
sometimes for <i>asp</i>, the tree now called by the adjectival
name aspen (cf. linden). We find Thomas <i>atte</i> <i>apse</i>
in the reign of Edward III.</p>
<p>The letters <i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i> also tend to
disappear from no other cause than rapid or careless
pronunciation.</p>
<p>Hence we get <i>Home</i> for <i>Holme</i> (Chapter XII),
<i>Ferris</i> for <i>Ferrers</i>, a French local name,
<i>Batt</i> for Bartholomew, <i>Gatty</i> for Gertrude,
<i>Dallison</i> for <i>d'Alen&ccedil;on</i>. The loss of
-<i>r</i>- after a vowel is also exemplified by <i>Foster</i> for
<i>Forster</i>, <i>Pannell</i> and <i>Pennell</i> for
<i>Parnell</i> (sometimes), <i>Gath</i> for <i>Garth</i> (Chapter
XIII), and <i>Mash</i> for <i>Marsh</i>. To the loss of <i>n</i>
before <i>s</i> we owe such names as <i>Pattison</i>,
<i>Paterson</i>, <i>etc</i>., son of <i>Paton</i>, the dim. of
Patrick, and <i>Robison</i> for Robinson, and also a whole group
of names like <i>Jenks</i> and <i>Jinks</i> for <i>Jenkins</i>
(John), <i>Wilkes</i> for <i>Wilkins</i>, <i>Gilkes</i>,
<i>Danks</i>, <i>Perks</i>, <i>Hawkes</i>, <i>Jukes</i> for
<i>Judkins</i> (Chapter VI), etc. Here I should also include
<i>Biggs</i>, which is not always connected with <i>Bigg</i>, for
we seldom find adjectival nicknames with -<i>s</i>. It seems to
represent <i>Biggins</i>, from obsolete <i>biggin</i>, a building
(Chapter XIII).</p>
<p>The French nasal <i>n</i> often disappeared before <i>r</i>.
Thus <i>denr&eacute;e</i>, lit. a pennyworth, appears in
Anglo-French as <i>darree</i>. Similarly <i>Henry</i> became
<i>Harry</i>, except in Scotland, and the English Kings of that
name were always called Harry by their subjects. It is to this
pronunciation that we owe the popularity of <i>Harris</i> and
<i>Harrison</i>, and the frequency of Welsh <i>Parry</i>, ap,
Harry, as compared with <i>Penry</i>. A compromise between Henry
and Harry is seen in <i>Hanrott</i>, from the French dim.
Henriot.</p>
<p>The initial <i>h</i>-, which we regard with such veneration,
is treated quite arbitrarily in surnames. We find a well-known
medieval poet called indifferently <i>Occleve</i> and
<i>Hoccleve</i>. <i>Harnett</i> is the same as <i>Arnett</i>, for
Arnold, <i>Ewens</i> and <i>Heavens</i> are both from
<i>Ewan</i>, and <i>Heaven</i> is an imitative form of
<i>Evan</i>. In <i>Hoskins</i>, from the medieval Osekin, a dim.
of some Anglo-Saxon name such as Oswald (Chapter VII), the
aspirate has definitely prevailed. The Devonshire name <i>Hexter
is</i> for Exeter, <i>Arbuckle</i> is a corruption of Harbottle,
in Northumberland. The Old French name Ancel appears as both
<i>Ansell</i> and <i>Hansell</i>, and <i>Earnshaw</i> exists side
by side with <i>Hearnshaw</i> (Chapter XII).</p>
<p>The loss of <i>h</i> is especially common when it is the
initial letter of a suffix, e.g. <i>Barnum</i> for Barnham,
<i>Haslam</i>, (hazel), <i>Blenkinsop</i> for Blenkin's hope (see
hope, Chapter XII), <i>Newall</i> for Newhall, <i>Windle</i> for
Wind Hill, <i>Tickell</i> for Tick Hill, in Yorkshire, etc. But
<i>Barnum</i> and <i>Haslam</i> <i>may</i> also represent the
Anglo-Saxon dative plural of the words barn and hazel. A man who
minded sheep was once called a <i>Shepard</i>, or
<i>Sheppard</i>, as he still is, though we spell it
<i>shepherd</i>. The letter <i>w</i> disappears in the same way;
thus <i>Green</i>i<i>sh</i> is for Greenwich, <i>Horridge</i> for
Horwich, <i>Aspinall</i> for Aspinwall, <i>Millard</i> for
<i>Millward</i>, the mill-keeper, <i>Boxall</i> for Boxwell,
<i>Caudle</i> for <i>Cauldwell</i> (cold); and the Anglo-Saxon
names in -<i>win</i> are often confused with those in -ing, e.g.
<i>Gooding</i>, <i>Goodwin;</i> <i>Golding</i>, <i>Goldwin;</i>
<i>Gunning</i>, <i>Gunwin</i>, etc. In this way <i>Harding</i>
has prevailed over the once equally common <i>Hardwin</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80716" id="Toc80716">BABY PHONETICS</a></b></p>
<p>Finally, we have to consider what may be called baby
phonetics, the sound-changes which seem rather to transgress
general phonetic laws. Young children habitually confuse dentals
and palatals, thus a child may be heard to say that he has "dot a
told." This tendency is, however, not confined to children. My
own name, which is a very uncommon one, is a stumbling-block to
most people, and when I give it in a shop the scribe has
generally got as far as <i>Wheat</i>- before he can be
stopped.</p>
<p>We find both <i>Estill</i> and <i>Askell</i> for the medieval
Asketil, and <i>Thurtle</i> alternating with <i>Thurkle</i>,
originally Thurketil (Chapter VII). <i>Bertenshave</i> is found
for <i>Birkenshaw</i>, birch wood, <i>Bartley</i>, sometimes from
Bartholomew, is more often for Berkeley, and both Lord Bacon and
Horace Walpole wrote Twitnam for Twickenham. <i>Jeffcock</i>,
dim. of Geoffrey, becomes <i>Jeffcott</i>, while <i>Glascock</i>
is for the local <i>Glascott</i>. Here the palatal takes the
place of the dental, as in <i>Brangwin</i> for Anglo-Sax.
Brandwine. <i>Middleman</i> is a dialect form of Michaelmas
(Chapter IX). We have the same change in <i>tiddlebat</i> for
<i>stickleback</i>, a word which exemplifies another point in
baby phonetics, viz. the loss of initial <i>s</i>-, as in the
classic instance <i>tummy</i>. To this loss of <i>s</i>- we owe
<i>Pick</i> for <i>Spick</i> (Chapter XXIII), <i>Pink</i> for
<i>Spink</i>, a dialect word for the chaffinch, and, I think,
<i>Tout</i> for <i>Stout</i>. The name <i>Stacey</i> is found as
<i>Tacey</i> in old Notts registers. On the other hand, an
inorganic <i>s</i>- is sometimes prefixed, as in <i>Sturgess</i>
for the older Turgis. For the loss of <i>s</i>- we may compare
Shakespeare's <i>parmaceti</i> (1 Henry <i>IV.</i> i. 3), and for
its addition the adjective <i>spruce</i>, from Pruce, <i>i.e</i>.
Prussia.</p>
<p>We also find the infantile confusion between <i>th</i> and
<i>f</i> e.g. in <i>Selfe</i>, which appears to represent a
personal name Seleth, probably from Anglo-Sax, <i>saelth</i>,
bliss. Perhaps also in Fripp for Thripp, a variant of
<i>Thrupp</i>, for <i>Thorp</i>. <i>Bickerstaffe</i> is the name
of a place in Lancashire, of which the older form appears in
<i>Bickersteth</i>, and the local name <i>Throgmorton</i> is
spelt by Camden Frogmorton, just as Pepys invariably writes
Queenhive for Queenhythe.</p>
<p>Such are some of the commoner phenomena to be noticed in
connection with the spelling and sound of our names. The student
must always bear in mind that our surnames date from a period
when nearly the whole population was uneducated. Their modern
forms depend on all sorts of circumstances, such as local
dialect, time of adoption, successive fashions in pronunciation
and the taste and fancy of the speller. They form part of our
language, that is, of a living and ever-changing organism. Some
of us are old enough to remember the confusion between initial
<i>v</i> and <i>w</i> which prompted the judge's question to Mr.
Weller. The vulgar <i>i</i> for <i>a</i>, as in "<i>tike</i> the
<i>kike</i>,<i>"</i> has been evolved within comparatively recent
times, as well as the loss of final -<i>g</i>, <i>"shootin</i>
and <i>huntin</i>,<i>"</i> in sporting circles. In the word

<p><i>(Great</i> <i>Expectations</i>, ch. xl.),</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">we have three phonetic
phenomena, all of which have influenced the form and sound of
modern surnames, e.g. in <i>Winter</i>, sometimes for
<i>Vinter</i>, <i>i.e</i>. vintner, <i>Clark</i> for
<i>Clerk</i>, and <i>Bryant</i> for <i>Bryan;</i> and similar
changes have been in progress all through the history of our
language.</font></p>
<p>In conclusion it may be remarked that the personal and
accidental element, which has so much to do with the development
of surnames, releases this branch of philology to some extent
from the iron rule of the phonetician. Of this the preceding
pages give examples. The name, not being subject as other words
are to a normalizing influence, is easily affected by the
traditional or accidental spelling. Otherwise <i>Fry</i> would be
pronounced <i>Free</i>. The <i>o</i> is short in <i>Robin</i> and
long in <i>Probyn</i>, and yet the names are the same (Chapter
VI). <i>Sloper</i> and <i>Smoker</i> mean a maker of slops and
smocks respectively, and <i>Smale</i> is an archaic spelling of
<i>Small</i>, the modern vowel being in each case lengthened by
the retention of an archaic spelling. The late Professor Skeat
rejects Bardsley's identification of <i>Waring</i> with Old Fr.
Garin or Warin, because the original vowel and the suffix are
both different. But <i>Mainwaring</i>, which is undoubtedly from
<i>mesnil</i>-<i>Warin</i> (Chapter XIV), shows Bardsley to be
right.</p>

of <i>Aps</i> by a simple genitive at a comparatively recent date, have
given undue prominence to a few very common names; cf. <i>Davies,

<p><b><a name="Toc80718" id="Toc80718">OCCUPATIVE
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Taking the different classes of surnames separately, the six
commonest occupative names are <i>Smith</i>, <i>Taylor</i>,
<i>Clark</i>, <i>Wright</i>, <i>Walker</i>, <i>Turner</i>. If we
exclude <i>Clark</i>, as being more often a nickname for the man
who could read and write, the sixth will be <i>Cooper</i>,
sometimes spelt <i>Cowper</i>.</p>
<p>The commanding position of <i>Smith</i> is due to the fact
that it was applied to all workers in every kind of metal. The
modern Smiths no doubt include descendants of medieval
blacksmiths, whitesmiths, bladesmiths, locksmiths, and many
others, but the compounds are not common as surnames. We find,
however, <i>Shoosmith</i>, <i>Shearsmith</i>, and <i>Nasmyth</i>,
the last being more probably for earlier Knysmith, <i>i.e</i>.
knife-smith, than for nail-smith, which was supplanted by
<i>Naylor</i>. <i>Grossmith</i> <i>I</i> guess to be an
accommodated form of the Ger. <i>Grobschmied</i>, blacksmith,
lit. rough smith, and <i>Goldsmith</i> is very often a Jewish
name for Ger. <i>Goldschmid</i>.</p>
<p><i>Wright</i>, obsolete perhaps as a trade name, has given
many compounds, including <i>Arkwright</i>, a maker of bins, or
<i>arks</i> as they were once called, <i>Tellwright</i>, a tile
maker, and many others which need no interpretation. The high
position of <i>Taylor</i> is curious, for there were other names
for the trade, such as <i>Seamen</i>, <i>Shapster</i>,
<i>Parmenter</i> (Chapter XVIII), and neither <i>Tailleur</i> nor
<i>Letailleur</i> are particularly common in French. The
explanation is that this name has absorbed the medieval
<i>Teler</i> and <i>Teller</i>, weaver, ultimately belonging to
Lat. <i>tela</i>, a web; &mdash; cf. the very common Fr.
<i>Tellier</i> and <i>Letellier</i>. In some cases also the Mid.
Eng. <i>teygheler</i>, <i>Tyler</i>, has been swallowed up.
<i>Walker</i>, <i>i.e</i>. trampler, meant a cloth fuller, but
another origin has helped to swell the numbers of the
clan&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><i><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">"Walkers</font> are
such as are otherwise called foresters. They are foresters
assigned by the King, who are walkers within a certain space of
ground assigned to their care" (Cowel's Interpreter).</i></p>
</div>
<p><i>Cooper</i>, a derivative
of Lat. <i>cupa</i> or <i>cuppa</i>, a vessel, is cognate with the famous
French name <i>Cuvier</i>, which has given our <i>Cover</i>, though this may
also be for coverer, <i>i.e.</i> tiler (Chapter XV).</p>
<p>Of occupative names which have also an official meaning, the
three commonest are <i>Ward</i>, <i>Bailey</i>, and
<i>Marshall</i>. <i>Ward</i>, originally abstract, is the same
word as Fr. <i>garde</i>. <i>Bailey</i>, Old Fr. <i>bailif</i>
<i>(bailli)</i>, ranges from a Scottish magistrate to a man in
possession. It is related to <i>bail</i> and to <i>bailey</i>, a
ward in a fortress, as in Old Bailey. <i>Bayliss</i> may come
from the Old French nominative <i>bailis</i> (Chapter I), or may
be formed like <i>Parsons</i>, etc. (Chapter XV). <i>Marshall</i>
(Chapter XX) may stand for a great commander or a shoeing-smith,
still called farrier-marshal in the army. The first syllable is
cognate with <i>mare</i> and the second means servant.
<i>Constable</i>, Lat. <i>comes</i> <i>stabuli</i>, stableman,
has a similar history.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80719" id="Toc80719">THE DISTRIBUTION OF
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>The commonest local names naturally include none taken from
particular places. The three commonest are <i>Hall</i>,
<i>Wood</i> and <i>Green</i>, from residence by the great house,
the wood, and the village green. Cf. the French names
<i>Lasalle</i>, <i>Dubois</i>, <i>Dupr&eacute;</i>. <i>Hall</i>
<i>is</i> sometimes for <i>Hale</i> (Chapter II), and its Old
French translation is one source of <i>Sale</i>. Next to these
come <i>Hill</i>, <i>Moore</i>, and <i>Shaw</i> (Chapter XII);
but <i>Lee</i> would probably come among the first if all its
variants were taken into account (Chapter III).</p>
<p>Of baptismal names used unaltered as surnames the six
commonest are <i>Thomas</i>, <i>Lewis</i>, <i>Martin</i>,
<i>James</i>, <i>Morris</i>, <i>Morgan</i>. Here again the Welsh
element is strong, and four of these names, ending in -<i>s</i>,
belong also to the next group, <i>i.e</i>. the class of surnames
formed from the genitive of baptismal names. The frequent
occurrence of <i>Lewis</i> is partly due to its being adopted as
a kind of translation of the Welsh Llewellyn, but the name is
often a disguised Jewish Levi, and has nearly absorbed the local
<i>Lewes</i>. Next to the above come <i>Allen</i>,
<i>Bennett</i>, <i>Mitchell</i>, all of French introduction.
<i>Mitchell</i> may have been reinforced by <i>Mickle</i>, the
northern for <i>Bigg</i>. It is curious that these particularly
common names, <i>Martin</i>, <i>Allen</i>, <i>Bennett</i>
(Benedict), <i>Mitchell</i> (Michael), have formed comparatively
few derivatives and are generally found in their unaltered form.
Three of them are from famous saints' names, while <i>Allen</i>,
a Breton name which came in with the Conquest, has probably
absorbed to some extent the Anglo-Saxon name <i>Alwin</i>
(Chapter VII). <i>Martin</i> is in some cases an animal nickname,
the <i>marten</i>. Among the genitives <i>Jones</i>,
<i>Williams</i>, and <i>Davi(e)s</i> lead easily, followed by
<i>Evans</i>, <i>Roberts</i>, and <i>Hughes</i>, all Welsh in the
main. Among the twelve commonest names of this class those that
are not preponderantly Welsh are <i>Roberts</i>, <i>Edwards</i>,
<i>Harris</i>, <i>Phillips</i>, and <i>Rogers</i>. Another Welsh
patronymic, <i>Price</i> (Chapter VI), is among the fifty
commonest English names.</p>
<p>The classification of names in -<i>son</i> raises the
difficult question as to whether <i>Jack</i> represents Fr.
<i>Jacques</i>, or whether it comes from <i>Jankin</i>,
<i>Jenkin</i>, dim. of John. <i>[Footnote:</i> See E. B.
Nicholson, <i>The</i> <i>Pedigree</i> <i>of</i> <i>Jack</i>.]</p>
<p>Taking <i>Johnson</i> and <i>Jackson</i> as separate names, we
get the order <i>Johnson</i>, <i>Robinson</i>, <i>Wilson</i>,
<i>Thompson</i>, <i>Jackson</i>, <i>Harrison</i>. The variants of
<i>Thompson</i> might put it a place or two higher. Names in
-<i>kins</i> (Distribution of names, Chapter IV), though very
numerous in some regions, are not so common as those in the above
classes. It would be hard to say which English font-name has
given the largest number of family names. In Chapter V. will be
found some idea of the bewildering and multitudinous forms they
assume. It has been calculated, I need hardly say by a German
professor, that the possible number of derivatives from one given
name is 6, 000, but fortunately most of the seeds are
abortive.</p>
<p>Of nicknames <i>Brown</i>, <i>Clark</i>, and <i>White</i> are
by far the commonest. Then comes <i>King</i>, followed by the two
adjectival nicknames <i>Sharp</i> and <i>Young</i>.</p>
<p>The growth of towns and facility of communication are now
bringing about such a general movement that most regions would
accept <i>Brown</i>, <i>Jones</i> and <i>Robinson</i> as fairly
typical names. But this was not always so. <i>Brown</i> is still
much commoner in the north than in the south, and at one time the
northern <i>Johnson</i> and <i>Robinson</i> contrasted with the
southern <i>Jones</i> and <i>Roberts</i>, the latter being of
comparatively modern origin in Wales (Chapter IV). Even now, if
we take the farmer class, our nomenclature is largely regional,
and the directories even of our great manufacturing towns
represent to a great extent the medieval population of the rural
district around them. <i>[Footnote:</i> <i>See</i> Guppy,
<i>Homes</i> <i>of</i> <i>Family</i> <i>Names</i>.] The names
<i>Daft</i> and <i>Turney</i>, well known in Nottingham, appear
in the county in the Hundred Rolls. <i>Cheetham</i>, the name of
a place now absorbed in Manchester, is as a surname ten times
more numerous there than in London, and the same is true of many
characteristic north-country names, such as the
<i>Barraclough</i>, <i>Murgatroyd</i>, and <i>Sugden</i> of
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <i>Shirley</i>. The transference of
<i>Murgatroyd</i> (Chapter XII) to Cornwall, in Gilbert and
Sullivan's <i>Ruddigore</i>, must have been part of the
intentional topsy-turvydom in which those two bright spirits
delighted.</p>
<p>Diminutives in -<i>kin</i>, from the Old Dutch suffix
-<i>ken</i>, are still found in greatest number on the east coast
that faces Holland, or in Wales, where they were introduced by
the Flemish weavers who settled in Pembrokeshire in the reign of
Henry I. It is in the border counties, Cheshire, Shropshire,
Hereford, and Monmouth, that we find the old Welsh names such as
<i>Gough</i>, <i>Lloyd</i>, <i>Onion</i> (Enion), <i>Vaughan</i>
(Chapter XXII). The local Gape, an opening in the cliffs, is
pretty well confined to Norfolk, and <i>Puddifoot</i> belongs to
Bucks and the adjacent counties as it did in 1273. The hall

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80721" id="Toc80721">THE HUGUENOTS</a></b></p>
<p>The great mass of those names of French or Flemish origin
which do not date back to the Conquest or to medieval times are
due to the immigration of Protestant refugees in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. It is true that many names for which
Huguenot ancestry is claimed were known in England long before
the Reformation. Thus, <i>Bulteel</i> <i>is</i> the name of a
refugee family which came from Tournay about the year 1600, but
the same name is found in the Hundred Rolls Of 1273. The
<i>Grubbe</i> family, according to Burke, came from Germany about
1450, after the Hussite persecution; but we find the name in
England two centuries earlier, "without the assistance of a
foreign persecution to make it respectable" (Bardsley,
<i>Dictionary</i> <i>of</i> <i>English</i> <i>Surnames)</i>. The
<i>Minet</i> family is known to be of Huguenot origin, but the
same name also figures in the medieval Rolls. The fact is that
there was all through the Middle Ages a steady immigration of
foreigners, whether artisans, tradesmen, or adventurers, some of
whose names naturally reappear among the Huguenots. On several
occasions large bodies of Continental workmen, skilled in special
trades, were brought into the country by the wise policy of the
Government. Like the Huguenots later on, they were protected by
the State and persecuted by the populace, who resented their
habits of industry and sobriety.</p>
<p>During the whole period of the religious troubles in France
and Flanders, starting from the middle of the sixteenth century,
refugees were reaching this country in a steady stream; but after
the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) they arrived in
thousands, and the task of providing for them and helping on
their absorption into the population became a serious problem.
Among the better class of these immigrants was to be found the
flower of French intellect and enterprise, and one has only to
look through an Army or Navy list, or to notice the names which
are prominent in the Church, at the Bar, and in the higher walks
of industry and commerce, to realize the madness of Louis XIV.
and the wisdom of the English Government.</p>
<p>Here are a few taken at random from Smiles's <i>History</i>
<i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Huguenots&mdash;Bosanquet</i>,
<i>Casaubon</i>, <i>Chenevix</i> <i>Trench</i>, <i>Champion</i>
<i>de</i> <i>Crespigny</i>, <i>Dalbiac</i>, <i>Delane</i>,
<i>Dollond</i>, <i>Durand</i>, <i>Fonblanque</i>, <i>Gambier</i>,
<i>Garrick</i>, <i>Layard</i>, <i>Lefanu</i>, <i>Lefroy</i>,
<i>Ligonier</i>, <i>Luard</i>, <i>Martineau</i>, <i>Palairet</i>,
<i>Perowne</i>, <i>Plimsoll</i>, <i>Riou</i>, <i>Romilly</i>
<i>&mdash;</i> <i>all</i> respectable and many distinguished,
even cricket being represented. These more educated foreigners
usually kept their names, sometimes with slight modifications
which do not make them unrecognizable. Thus, <i>Bouverie</i>,
literally "ox-farm," is generally found in its unaltered form,
though the <i>London</i> <i>Directory</i> has also examples of
the perverted <i>Buffery</i>. But the majority of the immigrants
were of the artisan class and illiterate. This explains the
extraordinary disappearance, in the course of two centuries, of
the thousands of French names which were introduced between 1550
and 1700.</p>
<p>We have many official lists of these foreigners, and in these
lists we catch the foreign name in the very act of transforming
itself into English. This happens sometimes by translation, e.g.
<i>Poulain</i> became <i>Colt</i>, <i>Poisson</i> was
reincarnated as <i>Fish</i>, and a refugee bearing the somewhat
uncommon name <i>Petitoeil</i> transformed himself into
<i>Little</i>-<i>eye</i>, which became in <i>a</i> few
generations <i>Lidley</i>. But comparatively few surnames were
susceptible of such simple treatment, and in the great majority
of cases the name underwent a more or less arbitrary perversion
which gave it a more English physiognomy. Especially interesting
from this point <i>of</i> view is the list of&mdash; "Straungers
residing and dwellinge within the city of London and the
liberties thereof," drawn up in 1618. The names were probably
taken down by the officials of the different wards, <i>who</i>,
differing themselves in intelligence and orthography, produced
very curious results.</p>
<p>As a rule the Christian name is translated, while the surname
is either assimilated to some English form or perverted according
to the taste and fancy of the individual constable. Thus,
<i>John</i> <i>Garret</i>, a Dutchman, is probably <i>Jan</i>
<i>Gerard</i>, and <i>James</i> <i>Flower</i>, a milliner, born
in Rouen, is certainly <i>Jaques</i> <i>Fleur</i>, or
<i>Lafleur</i>. <i>John</i> <i>de</i> <i>Cane</i> and
<i>Peter</i> <i>le</i> <i>Cane</i> are <i>Jean</i>
<i>Duquesne</i> and <i>Pierre</i> <i>Lequesne</i> (Norman
<i>qu&ecirc;ne</i>, oak), though the former may also have come
from <i>Caen</i>. <i>John</i> <i>Buck</i>, from Rouen, is
<i>Jean</i> <i>Bouc</i>, and <i>Abraham</i> <i>Bushell</i>, from
Rochelle, was probably a <i>Roussel</i> or <i>Boissel</i>.
<i>James</i> <i>King</i> and <i>John</i> <i>Hill</i>, both
Dutchmen, are obvious translations of common Dutch names, while
<i>Henry</i> <i>Powell</i>, a German, is <i>Heinrich</i>
<i>Paul</i>. <i>Mary</i> <i>Peacock</i>, from Dunkirk, and
<i>John</i> <i>Bonner</i>, a Frenchman, I take to be <i>Marie</i>
<i>Picot</i> and <i>Jean</i> <i>Bonheur</i>, while
<i>Nicholas</i> <i>Bellow</i> is surely <i>Nicolas</i>
<i>Belleau</i>. <i>Michael</i> <i>Leman</i>, born in Brussels,
may be French <i>Leman</i> or <i>Lemoine</i>, or perhaps German
<i>Lehmann</i>.</p>
<p>To each alien's name is appended that of the monarch whose
subject he calls himself, but a republic is outside the
experience of one constable, who leaves an interrogative blank
after <i>Cristofer</i> <i>Switcher</i>, born at <i>Swerick</i>
(Z&uuml;rich) in <i>Switcherland</i>. The surname so ingeniously
created appears to have left no pedagogic descendants. In some
cases the harassed Bumble has lost patience, and substituted a
plain English name for foreign absurdity. To the brain which
christened Oliver Twist we owe <i>Henry</i> <i>Price</i>, a
subject of the King of Poland, <i>Lewis</i> <i>Jackson</i>, a
"Portingall," and <i>Alexander</i> <i>Faith</i>, a steward to the
Venice Ambassador, born in the dukedom of Florence.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80722" id="Toc80722">PERVERSIONS OF FOREIGN
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>In the returns made outside the bounds of the city proper the
aliens have added their own signatures, or in some cases made
their marks. <i>Jacob</i> <i>Alburtt</i> signs himself as
<i>Jacob</i> <i>Elbers</i>, and <i>Croft</i> <i>Castell</i> as
<i>Kraft</i> <i>Kassels</i>. <i>Harman</i> <i>James</i> is the
official translation of <i>Hermann</i> <i>Jacobs</i>, <i>Mary</i>
<i>Miller</i> of <i>Marija</i> <i>Moliner</i>, and <i>John</i>
<i>Young</i> of <i>Jan</i> <i>le</i> <i>Jeune</i>. <i>Gyllyam</i>
<i>Spease</i>, for <i>Wilbert</i> <i>Spirs</i>, seems to be due
to a Welsh constable, and <i>Chrystyan</i> <i>Wyhelhames</i>, for
<i>Cristian</i> <i>Welselm</i>, looks like a conscientious
attempt at Williams. One registrar, with a phonetic system of his
own, has transformed the Dutch <i>Moll</i> into the more familiar
<i>Maule</i>, and has enriched his list with <i>Jannacay</i>
<i>Yacopes</i> for <i>Jantje</i> <i>Jacobs</i>. <i>Lowe</i>
<i>Luddow</i>, who signs himself <i>Louij</i> <i>Ledou</i>, seems
to be <i>Louis</i> <i>Ledoux</i>. An alien who writes himself
<i>Jann</i> <i>Eisankraott</i> (Ger. <i>Eisenkraut? )</i> cannot
reasonably complain plain at being transformed into <i>John</i>
<i>Isacrocke</i>, but the substitution of <i>John</i>
<i>Johnson</i> for <i>Jansen</i> <i>Vandrusen</i> suggests that
this individual's case was taken at the end of a long day's
work.</p>
<p>These examples, taken at random, show how the French and
Flemish names of the humbler refugees lost their foreign
appearance. In many cases the transformation was etymologically
justified. Thus, some of our <i>Druitts</i> and <i>Drewetts</i>
may be descended from <i>Martin</i> <i>Druett</i>, the first name
on the list. But this is probably the common French name
<i>Drouet</i> or <i>Drouot</i>, assimilated to the English
<i>Druitt</i>, which we find in 1273. And both are diminutives of
Drogo, which occurs in <i>Domesday Book</i>, and is, through Old
French, the origin of our <i>Drew</i>. But in many cases the name
has been so deformed that one can only guess at the continental
original. I should conjecture, for instance, that the curious
name <i>Shoppee</i> is a corruption of <i>Chappuis</i>, the Old
French for a carpenter, and that</p>
<p><i>Jacob</i> <i>Shophousey</i>, registered as a German cutler,
came from <i>Schaffhausen</i>. In this particular region of
English nomenclature a little guessing is almost excusable. The
law of probabilities makes it mathematically certain that the
horde of immigrants included representatives of all the very
common French family names, and it would be strange if

<p><b><a name="Toc80723" id="Toc80723">JEWISH NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>The Jewish names of German origin which are now so common in
England mostly date from the beginning of the nineteenth century,
when laws were passed in Austria, Prussia and Bavaria to compel
all Jewish families to adopt a fixed surname. Many of them chose
personal names, e.g. <i>Jakobs</i>, <i>Levy</i>, <i>Moses</i>,
for this purpose, while others named themselves from their place
of residence, e.g. <i>Cassel</i>, <i>Speyer</i> (Spires),
<i>Hamburg</i>, often with the addition of the syllable
-<i>er</i>, e.g. <i>Darmesteter</i>, <i>Homburger</i>. Some
families preferred descriptive names such as <i>Selig</i>
(Chapter XXII), <i>Sonnenschein</i>, <i>Goldmann</i>, or invented
poetic and gorgeous place-names such as <i>Rosenberg</i>,
<i>Blumenthal</i>, <i>Goldberg</i>, <i>Lilienfeld</i>. The
oriental fancy also showed itself in such names as
<i>Edelstein</i>, jewel, <i>Glueckstein</i>, luck stone,
<i>Rubinstein</i>, ruby, <i>Goldenkranz</i>, golden wreath, etc.
<i>[Footnote:</i> Our <i>Touchstone</i> would seem also to be a
nickname. The obituary of a Mr. Touchstone appeared in the
<i>Manchester</i> <i>Guardian</i>, December 12, 1912.<i>]</i> It
is owing to the existence of the last two groups that our
fashionable intelligence is now often so suggestive of a
wine-list. Among animal names adopted the favourites were
<i>Adler</i>, eagle, <i>Hirsch</i>, hart, <i>L&ouml;we</i>, lion,
and <i>Wolf</i>, each of which is used with symbolic significance
in the Old Testament.</p>

<i>Rebellion</i>.)</p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Gower's lines on the peasant
rebels give us some idea of the names which were most popular in
the fourteenth century, and which have consequently impressed
themselves most strongly on our modern surnames. It will be
noticed that one member of the modern triumvirate, Harry, or Hal,
is absent. <i>[Footnote:</i> The three names were not definitely
established till the nineteenth century. Before that period they
had rivals. French says <i>Pierre</i> et <i>Paul</i>, and German
<i>Heinz</i> and <i>Kunz</i>, <i>i.e</i>. Heinrich and
Conrad.<i>]</i> The great popularity of this name probably dates
from a rather later period and is connected with the exploits of
Henry V. Moreover, all the names, with the possible exception of
Hud, are of French introduction and occur rarely before the
Conquest. The old Anglo-Saxon names did survive, especially in
the remoter parts of the country, and have given us many surnames
(see ch. vii.), but even in the Middle Ages people had a
preference for anything that came over with the Conqueror. French
names are nearly all of German origin, the Celtic names and the
Latin names which encroached on them having been swept away by
the Frankish invasion, a parallel to the wholesale adoption of
Norman names in England. Thus our name <i>Harvey</i>, no longer
usual as a font-name, is Fr. Herod, which represents the heroic
German name Herewig, to the second syllable of which belongs such
an apparently insignificant name as <i>Wigg</i>.</font></p>

<p>The disappearance of Latin names is not to be regretted, for
the Latin nomenclature was of the most unimaginative description,
while the Old German names are more like those of Greece; e.g.
Ger. Ludwig, which has passed into most of the European languages
(Louis, Lewis, Ludovico, etc), is from Old High Ger.

Greek Clytomachus, with one-half of which it is etymologically
cognate.</p>
<p>Some of the names in Gower's list, e.g. <i>Watte</i> (Chapter
I), <i>Thomme</i>, <i>Symme</i>, <i>Geffe</i> (Chapter VI),
<i>Wille</i>, <i>Jakke</i>, are easily recognized. <i>Bette</i>
is for <i>Bat</i>, Bartholomew, a name, which has given
<i>Batty</i>, <i>Batten</i>, <i>Bates</i>, <i>Bartle</i> (cf.
Bartlemas), <i>Bartlett</i>, <i>Badcock</i>, <i>Batcock</i>. But
this group of names belongs also to the Bert- or -bent, which is
so common in Teutonic names, such as Bertrand, Bertram, Herbert,
Hubert, many of which reached us in an Old French form. For the
loss of the -<i>r</i>-, cf. Matty from Martha. <i>Gibe</i> is for
Gilbert. <i>Hick</i> is rimed on Dick: (Chapter VI). <i>Colle</i>
is for Nicolas. <i>Grig</i> is for Gregory, whence <i>Gregson</i>
and Scottish <i>Grier</i>. <i>Dawe</i>, for David, alternated
with <i>Day</i> and <i>Dow</i>, which appear as first element in
many surnames, though <i>Day</i> has another origin (Chapter XIX)
and <i>Dowson</i> sometimes belongs to the female name
<i>Douce</i>, sweet. <i>Hobbe</i> is a rimed form from Robert.
<i>Lorkyn</i>, or <i>Larkin</i>, <i>is</i> for Lawrence, for
which we also find <i>Law</i>, <i>Lay</i>, and <i>Low</i>, whence
<i>Lawson</i>, <i>Lakin</i>, <i>Lowson</i>, <i>Locock</i>, etc.
For <i>Hudde</i> see Chapters I, VII. <i>Judde</i>, from the very
popular <i>Jordan</i>, has given <i>Judson</i>, <i>Judkins</i>,
and the contracted <i>Jukes</i>. <i>Jordan</i> (Fr. Jourdain,
Ital. Giordano) seems to have been adopted as a personal name in
honour of John the Baptist. <i>Tebbe</i> <i>is</i> for Theobald

<p><b><a name="Toc80726" id="Toc80726">THE COMMONEST
FONT-NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Many people, in addressing a small boy with whom they are
unacquainted, are in the habit of using Tommy as a name to which
any small boy should naturally answer. In some parts of Polynesia
the natives speak of a white Mary or a black Mary, <i>i.e</i>.
woman, just as the Walloons round Mons speak of Marie bon bec, a
shrew, Marie grognon, a Mrs. Gummidge, Marie quatre langues, a
chatterbox, and several other Maries still less politely
described. We have the modern silly Johnny for the older silly
Billy, while Jack Pudding is in German Hans Wurst, John Sausage.
Only the very commonest names are used in this way, and, if we
had no further evidence, the rustic Dicky bird, Robin redbreast,
Hob goblin, Tom tit, Will o' the Wisp, Jack o' lantern, etc.,
would tell us which have been in the past the most popular
English font-names. During the Middle Ages there was a kind of
race among half a dozen favourite names, the prevailing order
being John, William, Thomas, Richard, Robert, with perhaps Hugh
as sixth.</p>
<p>Now, for each of these there is a reason. John, a favourite
name in so many languages (Jean, Johann, Giovanni, Juan, Ian,
Ivan, etc.), as the name of the Baptist and of the favoured
disciple, defied even the unpopularity of our one King of that
name. The special circumstances attending the birth and naming of
the Baptist probably supplied the chief factor in its
triumph.</p>
<p>For some time after the Conquest William led easily. We
usually adopted the <i>W</i>- form from the north-east of France,
but Guillaume has also supplied a large number of surnames in
<i>Gil</i>-, which have got inextricably mixed up with those
derived from Gilbert, Gillian (Juliana), and Giles. <i>Gilman</i>
represents the French dim. Guillemin, the local-looking
<i>Gilliam</i> <i>is</i> simply Guillaume, and <i>Wilmot</i>
corresponds to Fr. Guillemot.</p>
<p>The doubting disciple held a very insignificant place until
the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury became one of the holy
places of Christendom. To Thomas belong <i>Macey</i>,
<i>Massie</i>, and <i>Masson</i>, dims. of French aphetic forms,
but the first two are also from Old French forms of Matthew, and
<i>Masson</i> <i>is</i> sometimes an alternative form of
<i>Mason</i>.</p>
<p>Robert and Richard were both popular Norman names. The first
was greatly helped by Robin Hood and the second by the
Lion-Heart.</p>
<p>The name Hugh was borne by several saints, the most famous of
whom in England was the child-martyr, St. Hugh of Lincoln, said
to have been murdered by the Jews C. 1250. It had a dim.
<i>Huggin</i> and also the forms <i>Hew</i> and <i>How</i>,
whence <i>Hewett</i>, <i>Hewlett</i>, <i>Howitt</i>,
<i>Howlett</i>, etc., while from the French dim. Huchon we get
<i>Hutchin</i> and its derivatives, and also <i>Houchin</i>. Hugh
also appears in the rather small class of names represented by
<i>Littlejohn</i>, <i>Meiklejohn</i>, etc. <i>[Footnote:</i> This
formation seems to be much commoner in French. In the "Bottin" I
find Grandblaise, Grandcollot (Nicolas), Grandgeorge,
Grandg&eacute;rard, Grandguillaume, Grandguillot, Grandjacques,
Grand-jean, Grandperrin (Pierre), Grandpierre, Grandremy,
Grandvincent, and Petitcolin, Petitdemange (Dominique),
Petitdidier (Desiderius), Petit-Durand, Petit-Etienne (Stephen),

Petitperrin, Petit-Richard.<i>]</i> We find <i>Goodhew</i>,
<i>Goodhue</i>. Cf. <i>Gaukroger</i>, <i>i.e</i>. awkward Roger,
and <i>Goodwillie</i>. But the more usual origin of
<i>Goodhew</i>, <i>Goodhue</i> <i>is</i> from Middle Eng.
<i>heave</i>, servant, hind. Cf. <i>Goodhind</i>.</p>
<p>Most of the other names in Gower's list have been prolific. We
might add to them Roger, whence <i>Hodge</i> and <i>Dodge</i>,
<i>Humfrey</i>, which did not lend itself to many variations, and
Peter, from the French form of which we have many derivatives
(Chapter III), including perhaps the Huguenot <i>Perowne</i>, Fr.
Perron, but this can also be local, du Perron, the etymology,
Lat. <i>Petra</i>, rock, remaining the same.</p>
<p>The absence of the great names Alfred <i>[Footnote:</i> The
name <i>Alured</i> is due to misreading of the older
<i>Alvred</i>, <i>v</i> being written <i>u</i> in old MSS.
<i>Allfrey</i> is from the Old French form of the name.<i>]</i>
and Edward is not surprising, as they belonged to the conquered
race. Though Edward was revived as the name of a long line of
Kings, its contribution to surnames has been small, most names in
<i>Ed</i>-, <i>Ead</i>-, e.g. <i>Ede</i>, <i>Eden</i>,
<i>Edison</i>, <i>Edkins</i>, <i>Eady</i>, <i>etc</i>., belonging
rather to the once popular female name Eda or to Edith, though in
some cases they are from Edward or other Anglo-Saxon names having
the same initial syllable. James is a rare name in medieval
rolls, being represented by Jacob, and no doubt partly by Jack
(Chapter IV). It is&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80727" id="Toc80727">FASHIONS IN
FONT-NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>The force of royal example is seen in the popularity under the
Angevin kings of Henry, or Harry, Geoffrey and Fulk, the three
favourite names in that family. For Harry see Chapter III.
Geoffrey, from Ger. Gottfried, Godfrey, has given us a large
number of names in <i>Geff</i>-, <i>Jeff</i>-, and <i>Giff</i>-,
<i>Jiff</i>-, and probably also <i>Jebb</i>, <i>Gepp</i> and
<i>Jepson</i>, while to <i>Fulk</i> we owe <i>Fewkes</i>,
<i>Foakes</i>, <i>Fowkes</i>, <i>Vokes</i>, etc., and perhaps in
some cases <i>Fox</i>. But it is impossible to catalogue all the
popular medieval font-names. Many others will be found scattered
through this book as occasion or association suggests them.</p>
<p>Three names whose poor representation is surprising are
<i>Arthur</i>, <i>Charles</i> and <i>George</i>, the two great
Kings of medieval romance and the patron saint of Merrie England.
All three are fairly common in their unaltered form, and we find
also <i>Arter</i> for <i>Arthur</i>. But they have given few
derivatives, though <i>Atkins</i>, generally from <i>Ad</i>-,
<i>i.e</i>. Adam, may sometimes be from Arthur (cf. Bat for Bart,
Matty for Martha, etc.). Arthur is a rare medieval font-name, a
fact no doubt due to the sad fate of King John's nephew. Its
modern popularity dates from the Duke of Wellington, while
Charles and George were raised from obscurity by the Stuarts and
the Brunswicks. To these might be added the German name
Frederick, the spread of which was due to the fame of Frederick
the Great. It gave, however, in French the dissimilated
<i>Ferry</i>, one source of our surnames <i>Ferry</i>,
<i>Ferris</i>, though the former is generally local.
<i>[Footnote:</i> "For Frideric, the English have commonly used
Frery and Fery, which hath been now a long time a Christian name
in the ancient family of Tilney, and lucky to their house, as
they report." (Camden.)<i>]</i></p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we take from Gower's list a name which
is to-day comparatively rare, e.g. Gilbert, we find it
represented by a whole string of surnames, e.g. <i>Gilbart</i>,
<i>Gibbs</i>, <i>Gibson</i>, <i>Gibbon</i>, <i>Gibbins</i>,
<i>Gipps</i>, <i>Gipson</i>, to mention only the most familiar.
From the French dim. Gibelot we get the rather rare
<i>Giblett;</i> cf. <i>Hewlett</i> for Hew-el-et, <i>Hamlet</i>
for Ham-el-et (Hamo), etc.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80728" id="Toc80728">DERIVATIVES OF
FONT-NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>In forming patronymics from personal names, it is not always
the first syllable that is selected. In <i>Toll</i>,
<i>Tolley</i>, <i>Tollett</i>, from Bartholomew, the second has
survived, while <i>Philpot</i>, dim. of Philip, has given
<i>Potts</i>. From Alexander we get <i>Sanders</i> and
<i>Saunders</i>. But, taking, for simplicity, two instances in
which the first syllable has survived, we shall find plenty of
instruction in those two pretty men Robert and Richard. We have
seen (Chapter VI) that Roger gave <i>Hodge</i> and <i>Dodge</i>,
which, in the derivatives <i>Hodson</i> and <i>Dodson</i>, have
coalesced with names derived from Odo and the Anglo-Sax. Dodda
(Chapter VII). Similarly Robert gave <i>Rob</i>, <i>Hob</i> and
<i>Dob</i>, and Richard gave <i>Rick</i>, <i>Hick</i> and
<i>Dick</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> I believe, however, that Hob is in
some cases from Hubert, whence <i>Hubbard</i>, <i>Hibbert</i>,
<i>Hobart</i>, etc.<i>]</i> Hob, whence <i>Hobbs</i>, was
sharpened into Hop, whence Hopps. The diminutive <i>Hopkin</i>,
passing into Wales, gave <i>Popkin</i>, just as ap-Robin became
<i>Probyn</i>, ap-Hugh <i>Pugh</i>, ap-Owen <i>Bowen</i>, etc. In
the north <i>Dobbs</i> became <i>Dabbs</i> (p. A. Hob also
developed another rimed form Nob cf. to "hob-nob" with anyone),
whence <i>Nobbs</i> and <i>Nabbs</i>, the latter, of course,
being sometimes rimed on <i>Abbs</i>, from Abel or Abraham. Bob
is the latest variant and has not formed many surnames. Richard
has a larger family than Robert, for, besides <i>Rick</i>,
<i>Hick</i> and Dick, we have <i>Rich</i> and <i>Hitch</i>,
<i>Higg</i> and <i>Digg</i>. The reader will be able to continue
this genealogical tree for himself.</p>
<p>The full or the shortened name can become a surname, either
without change, or with the addition of the genitive -<i>s</i> or
the word -<i>son</i>, the former more usual in the south, the
latter in the north. To take a simple case, we find as surnames
<i>William</i>, <i>Will</i>, <i>Williams</i>, <i>Wills</i>,
<i>Williamson</i>, <i>Wilson</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> This suffix
has squeezed out all the others, though Alice John<i>son</i> is
theoretically absurd. In Mid. English we find daughter, father,
mother, brother and other terms of relationship used in this way,
e.g. in 1379, Agnes <i>Dyconwyfdowson</i>, the wife of Dow's son
Dick. Dawbarn, child of David, is still found. See also Chapter
XXI<i>]</i></p>
<p>From the short form we get diminutives by means of the English
suffixes -<i>ie</i> or -<i>y</i> (these especially in the north),
-<i>kin</i> (Chapter IV), and the French suffixes -<i>et</i>,
-<i>ot</i> (often becoming -<i>at</i> in English), -in,
-<i>on</i> (often becoming -<i>en</i> in English). Thus
<i>Willy</i>, <i>Wilkie</i>, <i>Willett</i>. I give a few
examples of surnames formed from each class</p>
<p>Ritchie (Richard), <i>Oddy</i> (Odo, whence also
<i>Oates)</i>, <i>Lambie</i> (Lambert), <i>Jelley</i> (Julian);
<i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Lamb</i> is also, of course, a nickname cf.
<i>Agnew</i>, Fr. <i>agneau</i>]</p>
<p><i>Dawkins</i>, <i>Dawkes</i> (David), <i>Hawkins</i>,
<i>Hawkes</i> (Hal), <i>Gilkins</i> (Geoffrey), <i>Perkins</i>,
<i>Perks</i> (Peter), <i>Rankin</i> (Randolf);</p>

<i>Bartlett</i> (Bartholomew), <i>Ricketts</i> (Richard),

<i>Relf)</i>, <i>Paton</i>
(Patrick), <i>Sisson</i> (Sirs, <i>i.e</i>. Cecilia),
<i>Gibbons</i> (Gilbert), <i>Beaton</i> (Beatrice).</p>
<p>In addition to the suffixes and diminutives already mentioned,
we have the two rather puzzling endings -<i>man</i> and
-<i>cock</i>. <i>Man</i> occurs as an ending in several Germanic
names which are older than the Conquest, e.g. <i>Ashman</i>,
<i>Harman</i>, <i>Coleman;</i> and the simple <i>Mann</i> is also
an Anglo-Saxon personal name. It is sometimes to be taken
literally, e.g. in <i>Goodman</i>, <i>i.e</i>. master of the
house (Matt. xx. ii), <i>Longman</i>, <i>Youngman</i>,
<i>etc</i>. In <i>Hickman</i>, <i>Homan</i> (How, Hugh), etc., it
may mean servant of, as in <i>Ladyman</i>, <i>Priestman</i>, or
may be merely an augmentative suffix. In <i>Coltman</i>,
<i>Runciman</i>, it is occupative, the man in charge of the
colts, rouncies or nags. Chaucer's Shipman&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">"Rood upon a

</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">In <i>Bridgeman</i>,
<i>Pullman</i>, it means the man who lived near, or had some
office in connection with, the bridge or pool. But it is often
due to the imitative instinct. <i>Dedman</i> <i>is</i> for the
local Debenham, and <i>Lakeman</i> for Lakenham, while
<i>Wyman</i> represents the old name Wymond, and <i>Bowman</i>
and <i>Beeman</i> are sometimes for the local Beaumont (cf. the
pronunciation of Belvoir). But the existence in German of the
name <i>Bienemann</i> shows that <i>Beeman</i> may have meant
bee-keeper. <i>Sloman</i> may be a nickname, but also means the
man in the slough (Chapter XII), and <i>Godliman</i> <i>is</i> an
old familiar spelling of Godalming. We of course get doubtful
cases, e.g. <i>Sandeman</i> may be, as explained by Bardsley, the
servant of Alexander (Chapter VI), but it may equally well
represent Mid. Eng. <i>sandeman</i>, a messenger, and
<i>Lawman</i>, <i>Layman</i>, are rather to be regarded as
derivatives of <i>Lawrence</i> (Chapter VI) than what they appear
to be.</font></p>

-<i>COCK</i></a></b></p>
<p>Many explanations have been given of the suffix -<i>cock</i>,
but I cannot say that any of them have convinced me. Both
<i>Cock</i> and the patronymic <i>Cocking</i> are found as early
personal names. The suffix was added to the shortened form of
font-names, e.g. <i>Alcock</i> (Allen), Hi<i>tchcock</i>
(Richard), was apparently felt as a mere diminutive, and took an
-<i>s</i> like the diminutives in -<i>kin</i>, e.g.
<i>Willcocks</i>, <i>Simcox</i>. In <i>Hedgecock</i>,
<i>'Woodcock</i>, etc., it is of course a nickname. The modern

connotation, just as a man who treats his thirst generously is
vulgarly called a <i>Lushington</i>. <i>Bawcock</i> can easily be

<p>Although we are not dealing with Celtic names, a few words as
to the Scottish, Irish, and Welsh surnames which we find in our
directories may be useful. Those of Celtic origin are almost
invariably patronymics. The Scottish and Irish <i>Mac</i>, son,
used like the Anglo-Fr. <i>Fitz</i>-, ultimately means kin, and
is related to the -<i>mough</i> of <i>Watmough</i> (Chapter XXI)
and to the word <i>maid</i>. In <i>MacNab</i>, son of the abbot,
and <i>MacPherson</i>, son of the parson, we have curious
hybrids. In Manx names, such as <i>Quilliam</i> (Mac William),
<i>Killip</i> (Mac Philip), <i>Clucas</i> (Mac Lucas), we have
aphetic forms of <i>Mac</i>. The Irish <i>0'</i>, grandson,

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">In dealing with surnames we
begin after the Conquest, for the simple reason that there were
no surnames before. Occasionally an important person has come
down in history with a nickname, e.g. Edmund Iron-side, Harold
Harefoot, Edward the Confessor; but this is exceptional, and the
Anglo-Saxon, as a rule, was satisfied with one name. It is
probable that very many of the names in use before the Conquest,
whether of English or Scandinavian origin, were chosen because of
their etymological meaning, e.g. that the name Beornheard
<i>(Bernard</i>, <i>Barnard</i>, <i>Barnett)</i> was given to a
boy in the hope that he would grow up a warrior strong, just as
his sister might be called AEthelgifu, noble gift. The formation
of these old names is both interesting and, like all Germanic
nomenclature, poetic.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80732" id="Toc80732">FORMATION OF ANGLO-SAXON
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>As a rule the name consists of two elements, and the number of
those elements which appear with great frequency is rather
limited. Some themes occur only in the first half of the name,
e.g. <i>Aethel</i>-, whence Aethelstan, later <i>Alston</i>;
<i>AElf</i>-, whence AElfgar, now <i>Elgar</i> <i>and</i>
<i>Agar</i> <i>(AEthel</i>- and <i>AElf</i>- soon got confused,
so that <i>Allvey</i>, <i>Elvey</i> <i>may</i> represent both
AEthelwig and AElfwig, or perhaps in some cases Ealdwig);
<i>Cuth</i>-, whence Cuthbeald, now <i>Cobbold</i>
<i>[Footnote:</i> This is also the origin of Cupples, and
probably of <i>Keble</i> and <i>Nibbles</i>. It shares
<i>Cobbett</i> and <i>Cubitt</i> with Cuthbeorht.<i>];</i>
<i>Cyne</i>-, whence Cynebeald now <i>Kimball</i> and
<i>Kemble</i>, both of which are also local, <i>Folc</i>-, whence
Folcheard and Folchere, now <i>Folkard</i> and <i>Fulcher;</i>
<i>Gund</i>-, whence Gundred, now <i>Gundry</i> and <i>Grundy</i>
(Metathesis, Chapter III); <i>Os</i>-, whence <i>Osbert</i>,
<i>Osborn</i>,</p>
<p>Other themes only occur as the second half of <i>the</i> name.
Such are -<i>gifu</i>, in Godgifu, <i>i.e</i>. Godiva, whence
<i>Goodeve;</i> -<i>lac</i> in Guthlac, now <i>Goodlake</i> and
<i>Goodluck</i> (Chapter XXI); -<i>laf</i> in Deorlaf, now
<i>Dearlove;</i> -<i>wacer</i> in Eoforwacer, now
<i>Earwaker</i>.</p>
<p>Other themes, and perhaps the greater number, may occur
indifferently first and second, e.g. <i>beald</i>, <i>god</i>,
<i>here</i>, <i>sige</i>, <i>weald</i>, <i>win</i>, <i>wulf</i>
or <i>ulf</i>. Thus we have complete reversals in Beald-wine,
whence <i>Baldwin</i>, and Wine-beald, whence <i>Winbolt</i>,
Here-weald, whence <i>Herald</i>, <i>Harold</i>, <i>Harrod</i>,
and Weald-here, whence <i>Walter</i> (Chapter I). With these we
may compare Gold-man and Man-gold, the latter of which has given
<i>Mangles</i>. So also we have Sige-heard, whence
<i>Siggers</i>, and Wulf-sige, now <i>Wolsey</i>, Wulf-noth, now
the imitative <i>Wallnutt</i>, and Beorht-wulf, later Bardolph
and <i>Bardell</i>. The famous name <i>Havelock</i> was borne by
the hero of a medieval epic, "Havelock the Dane," but
<i>Dunstan</i> is usually for the local Dunston. On the other
hand, <i>Winston</i> is a personal name, Wine-stan, whence
<i>Winstanley</i>.</p>
<p>These examples show that the pre-Norman names are by no means
unrepresented in the twentieth century, but, in this matter, one
must proceed with caution. To take as examples the two names that
head this chapter, there is no doubt that Goderic and Godiva are
now represented by <i>Goodrich</i> and <i>Goodeve</i>, but these
may also belong to the small group mentioned in Chapter VI, and
stand for good Richard and good Eve. Also <i>Goodrich</i> comes
in some cases from Goodrich, formerly Gotheridge, in Hereford,
which has also given <i>Gutteridge</i>.</p>
<p>Moreover, it must not be forgotten that our medieval
nomenclature is preponderantly French, as the early rolls show
beyond dispute, so that, even where a modern name appears
susceptible of an Anglo-Saxon explanation, it is often safer to
refer it to the Old French cognate; for the Germanic names
introduced into France by the Frankish conquerors, and the
Scandinavian names which passed into Normandy, contained very
much the same elements as our own native names, but underwent a
different phonetic development. Thus I would rather explain
<i>Bawden</i>, <i>Bowden</i>, <i>Boulders</i>, <i>Boden</i>, and
the dims. <i>Body</i> and <i>Bodkin</i>, as Old French variants
from the Old Ger. Baldawin than as coming directly from
Anglo-Saxon. <i>Boyden</i> undoubtedly goes back to Old Fr.
Baudouin.</p>
<p>Practically all the names given in Gower's lines (Chapter V),
and many others to which I have ascribed a continental origin,
are found occasionally in England before the Conquest, but the
weight of evidence shows that they were either adopted in England
as French names or were corrupted in form by the Norman scribes
and officials. To take other examples, our <i>Tibbald</i>,
<i>Tibbles</i>, <i>Tibbs</i> suggest the Fr. Thibaut rather than
the natural development of Anglo-Sax. Thiudbeald, <i>i.e</i>.
Theobald; and <i>Ralph</i>, <i>Relf</i>, <i>Roff</i>, etc., show
the regular Old French development of Raedwulf, Radolf. Tibaut
Wauter, <i>i.e</i>. Theobald Walter, who lived in Lancashire in
1242, had both his names in an old French form.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80733" id="Toc80733">ANGLO-SAXON
NICKNAMES</a></b></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the various ways of forming nicknames or
descriptive names, are all used in the pre-Conquest personal
names. We find <i>Orme</i>, <i>i.e</i>. serpent or dragon (cf.
Great Orme's Head), Wulf, <i>i.e</i>. Wolf, Hwita, <i>i.e</i>.
<i>White</i>, and its derivative Hwiting, now <i>Whiting</i>,
Saemann, <i>i.e</i>. <i>Seaman</i>, Bonda, <i>i.e</i>.
<i>Bond</i>, Leofcild, dear child, now <i>Leif</i> <i>child</i>,
etc. But, except the case of <i>Orme</i>, <i>so</i> common as the
first element of place-names, I doubt the survival of these as
purely personal names into the surname period and regard
<i>White</i>, <i>Seaman</i>, <i>Bond</i>, <i>Leif</i>
<i>child</i> rather as new epithets of Mid. English formation.
<i>Whiting</i> <i>is</i> of course Anglo-Saxon, -<i>ing</i> being
the regular patronymic suffix. Cf. <i>Browning</i>,
<i>Benning</i>, <i>Dering</i>, <i>Dunning</i>, <i>Gunning</i>,
<i>Hemming</i>, <i>Kipping</i>, <i>Manning</i>, and many others
which occur in place-names. But not all names in -<i>ing</i> are
Anglo-Saxon, e.g. <i>Baring</i> <i>is</i> German; cf. Behring, of
the Straits; and <i>Jobling</i> <i>is</i> Fr. Jobelin, a double
dim. of Job.</p>
<p>I will now give a few examples of undoubted survival of these
Anglo-Saxon compounds, showing how the suffixes have been
corrupted and simplified. Among the commonest of these suffixes
are -<i>beald</i>, -<i>beorht</i>, -<i>cytel</i> (Chapter VII.),
-<i>god</i>, -<i>heard</i>, -<i>here</i>, -<i>man</i>,
-<i>mund</i>, -<i>raed</i>, -<i>ric</i>, -<i>weald</i>,
-<i>weard</i>, -<i>wine</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> Bold, bright,
kettle, god, strong, army, man, protection, counsel, powerful,
ruling, guard, friend.<i>]</i> which survive in <i>Rumball</i>
and <i>Rumbold</i> (Rumbeald), <i>Allbright</i> <i>[Footnote:</i>
AIbert is of modern German introduction.<i>]</i> and
<i>Allbutt</i> (Ealdbeorht, <i>i.e</i>. Albert), <i>Arkle</i>
(Earncytel), <i>Allgood</i> and <i>Elgood</i> (AElfgod),
<i>Everett</i> (Eoforheard, <i>i.e</i>. Everard), Gunter
(Gundhere), <i>Harman</i> (Hereman), <i>Redmond</i> (Raedmund),
<i>[Footnote:</i> Pure Anglo-Saxon, like the names of so many
opponents of English tyranny. <i>Parnell</i> is of course not
Irish (Chapter X).<i>]</i> <i>Aldred</i>, <i>Eldred</i>
<i>(</i>AEthelraed or Ealdraed), <i>Aldridge</i>,
<i>Alderick</i>, <i>Eldridge</i> (AEthelric or Ealdric),
<i>Thorold</i> (Thurweald), and, through Fr. Turold,
<i>Turrell</i>, <i>Terrell</i>, and <i>Tyrrell</i>,
<i>Harward</i> and <i>Harvard</i> (Hereweard), <i>Lewin</i>
(Leofwine).</p>
<p>In popular use some of these endings got confused, e.g.
<i>Rumbold</i> probably sometimes represents Rumweald, while
<i>Kennard</i> no doubt stands for Coenweard as well as for
Coenheard. <i>Man</i> and <i>round</i> were often interchanged
(Chapter VI), so that from Eastmund come both <i>Esmond</i> and
<i>Eastman</i>. <i>Gorman</i> represents Gormund, and
<i>Almond</i> (Chapter XI) is so common in the Middle Ages that
it must sometimes be from AEthelmund.</p>
<p>Sometimes the modern forms are imitative. Thus <i>Allchin</i>
<i>is</i> for Ealhwine (Alcuin), and <i>Goodyear</i>,
<i>Goodier</i> and <i>Goodair</i> <i>may</i> represent Godhere.
<i>[Footnote:</i> This may, however, be taken literally. There is
a German name <i>Gutjahr</i> and a Norfolk name
<i>Feaveryear</i>.] <i>Good</i>-<i>beer</i>, <i>Godbehere</i>,
<i>Gotobed</i> are classed by Bardsley under Godbeorht, whence
<i>Godber</i>. But in these three names the face value of the
words may well be accepted (pp. 156, 203, 206). Wisgar or
Wisgeard has given the imitative <i>Whisker</i> and
<i>Vizard</i>, and, through French, the Scottish <i>Wishart</i>,
which is thus the same as the famous Norman Guiscard.
<i>Garment</i> and <i>Rayment</i> are for Garmund and Regenmund,
<i>i.e</i>. Raymond.</p>

(Fastwulf), <i>Filmer</i> (Filumaer), <i>Frewin</i> eowine),
<i>Garrard</i>, <i>Garrett</i>, <i>Jarrold</i> (Gaerheard,

(Garbeald, with which cf. the Italian <i>Garibaldi)</i>,

by a descendant of the thane of the adjacent Gunnersbury.<i>]</i>
<i>Haines</i> (Hagene), <i>Haldane</i> (Haelfdene),
<i>Hastings</i> (Haesten, the Danish chief who gave his name to
Hastings, formerly Haestinga-ceaster), <i>Herbert</i>
(Herebeorht), <i>Herrick</i> Hereric), <i>Hildyard</i>
(Hildegeard), <i>Hubert</i>, <i>Hubbard</i>, <i>Hobart</i>,
<i>Hibbert</i> (Hygebeorht), <i>Ingram</i> (Ingelram),
<i>Lambert</i> (Landbeorht), <i>Livesey</i> (Leofsige),

<i>Manfrey</i> (Maegenfrith), <i>Rayner</i> (Regenhere),
<i>Raymond</i> (Regenmund), <i>Reynolds</i> (Regenweald),
<i>Seabright</i> (Sigebeorht or Saebeorht), <i>Sayers</i>
(Saegaer), <i>[Footnote:</i> The simple <i>Sayer</i> is also for
"assayer," either of metals or of meat and drink&mdash;
"<i>essayeur</i>, an essayer; one that tasts, or takes an essay;

of new Coyne before it be delivered out" (Cotgrave). Robert

(Wigmund), <i>Willard</i> (Wilheard), <i>Winfrey</i> (Winefrith),
<i>Ulyett</i> and <i>Woollett</i> (Wulfgeat), <i>Wolmer</i>
(Wulfmaer), <i>Woodridge</i> (Wulfric).</p>
<p>In several of these, e.g. <i>Fulcher</i>, <i>Hibbert</i>,
<i>Lambert</i>, <i>Reynolds</i>, the probability is that the name
came through French. Where an alternative explanation is
possible, the direct Anglo-Saxon origin is generally the less
probable. Thus, although Coning occurs as an Anglo-Saxon name,
<i>Collings</i> <i>is</i> generally a variant of <i>Collins</i>
(cf. <i>Jennings</i> for Jennins), and though <i>Hammond</i>
<i>is</i> etymologically Haganmund, it is better to connect it
with the very popular French name Hamon. <i>Simmonds</i> might
come from Sigemund, but is more likely from Simon with excrescent
-<i>d</i> (Epithesis, Chapter III).</p>
<p>In many cases the Anglo-Saxon name was a simplex instead of a
compound. The simple Cytel survives as <i>Chettle</i>,
<i>Kettle</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> Connected with the kettle or
cauldron of Norse mythology. The renowned Captain Kettle,
described by his creator as a Welshman, must have descended from
some hardy Norse pirate. Many names in this chapter are
Scandinavian.<i>]</i> Beorn is one of the origins of
<i>Barnes</i>. <i>Brand</i> also appears as <i>Braund</i>,
<i>Grim</i> <i>is</i> common in place-names, and from Grima we
have <i>Grimes</i>. Cola gives <i>Cole</i>, the name of a monarch
of ancient legend, but this name is more usually from Nicolas
(Chapter VI). Gonna is now <i>Gunn</i>, Serl has given the very
common <i>Searle</i>, and Wicga is <i>Wigg</i>. From Hacun we
have <i>Hack</i> and the dim. <i>Hackett</i>.</p>
<p>To these might be added many examples of pure adjectives, such
as Freo, <i>Free</i>, Froda, (prudent), <i>Froude</i>, Gods,
<i>Good</i>, Leof (dear), <i>Leif</i>, <i>Leaf</i>, Read (red),
<i>Read</i>, <i>Reid</i>, <i>Reed</i>, Rica, <i>Rich</i>, Rudda
(ruddy), <i>Rudd</i> and <i>Rodd</i>, Snel (swift, valiant),
<i>Snell</i>, Swet, <i>Sweet</i>, etc., or epithets such as Boda
(messenger), <i>Bode</i>, Cempa (warrior), <i>Kemp</i>, Cyta,
<i>Kite</i>, Dreng (warrior), <i>Dring</i>, Eorl, <i>Earl</i>,
Godcild, <i>Goodchild</i>, Nunna, <i>Nunn</i>, Oter,

<i>Seaman</i>, Spearhafoc, <i>Sparhawk</i>, <i>Spark</i> (Chapter

<i>Unwin</i>, etc. But many of these had died out as personal
names and, in medieval use, were nicknames pure and simple.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80735" id="Toc80735">MONOSYLLABIC
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Finally, there is a very large group of Anglo-Saxon
dissyllabic names, usually ending in -<i>a</i>, which appear to
be pet forms of the longer names, though it is not always
possible to establish the connection. Many of them have double
forms with a long and short vowel respectively. It is to this
class that we must refer the large number of our monosyllabic
surnames, which would otherwise defy interpretation. Anglo-Sax.
Dodds gave <i>Dodd</i>, while Dodson's partner <i>Fogg</i> had an
ancestor Focga. Other examples are Bacga, <i>Bagg</i>, Benna,
<i>Benn</i>, Bota, <i>Boot</i> and dim. <i>Booty</i>, Botts,
<i>Bolt</i>, whence <i>Bolting</i>, Bubba, <i>Bubb</i>, Budda,
<i>Budd</i>, Bynna, <i>Binns</i>, Cada, <i>Cade</i>, Cobbs,
<i>Cobb</i>, Coda, <i>Coad</i>, Codda, <i>Codd</i>, <i>Cuffs</i>,
<i>Cuff</i>, Deda, <i>Deedes</i>, Duda, <i>Dowd</i>, Duna,
<i>Down</i>, Donna, <i>Dunn</i>, Dutta, <i>Dull</i>, Eada,
<i>Eade</i>, <i>Edes</i>, etc., Ebba, <i>Ebbs;</i> Eppa,
<i>Epps</i>, Hudda, <i>Hud</i>, whence <i>Hudson</i>, Inga,
<i>Inge</i>, Sibba, <i>Sibbs</i>, Sicga, <i>Siggs</i>, Tata,
<i>Tate</i> and <i>Tait</i>, Tidda, <i>Tidd</i>, Tigga,
<i>Tigg</i>, Toca, <i>Tooke</i>, Tucca, <i>Tuck</i>, Wada,
<i>Wade</i>, Wadda, <i>Waddy</i>, etc. Similarly French took from
German a number of surnames formed from shortened names in
-<i>o</i>, with an accusative in -<i>on</i>, e.g. Old Ger. Bodo
has given Fr. Bout and Bouton, whence perhaps <i>our</i>
<i>Butt</i> and <i>Button</i>.</p>
<p>But the names exemplified above are very thinly represented in
early records, and, though their existence in surnames derived
from place-names <i>(Dodsley</i>, <i>Bagshaw</i>, <i>Bensted</i>,
<i>Bedworth</i>, <i>Cobham</i>, <i>Ebbsworth</i>, etc.) would
vouch for them even if they were not recorded, their comparative
insignificance is attested by the fact that they form very few
derivatives.</p>
<p>Compare, for instance, the multitudinous surnames which go
back to monosyllables of the later type of name, such as John and
Hugh, with the complete sterility of the names above. Therefore,
when an alternative derivation for a surname is possible, it is
usually ten to one that this alternative is right. <i>Dodson</i>
<i>is</i> a simplified <i>Dodgson</i>, from Roger (Chapter VI);
<i>Benson</i> belongs to Benedict, sometimes to Benjamin;
<i>Cobbett</i> <i>is</i> a disguised <i>Cuthbert</i> or
<i>Cobbold</i> (cf. <i>Garrett</i>, Chapter II); <i>Down</i> is
usually local, at the down or dune; <i>Dunn</i> is medieval
<i>le</i> <i>dun</i>, a colour nickname; names in <i>Ead</i>-,
<i>Ed</i>-, are usually from the medieval female name Eda
(Chapter VI); <i>Sibbs</i> generally belongs to Sibilla or
Sebastian; <i>Tait</i> must sometimes be for Fr.
<i>T&ecirc;te</i>, with which cf. Eng. <i>Head;</i> <i>Tidd</i>
<i>is</i> an old pet form of Theodore; and <i>Wade</i> <i>is</i>
more frequently <i>atte</i> <i>wade</i>, <i>i.e</i>. ford. Even
<i>Ebbs</i> and <i>Epps</i> are more likely to be shortened forms
of Isabella, usually reduced to Ib, or Ibbot (Chapter X), or of
the once popular Euphemia.</p>
<p>To sum up, we may say that the Anglo-Saxon element <i>in</i>
our surnames is much larger than one would imagine from
Bardsley's <i>Dictionary</i>, and that it accounts, not only for
names which have a distinctly Anglo-Saxon suffix or a disguised
form of one, but also for a very large number of monosyllabic
names which survive in isolation and without kindred. In this
chapter I have only given sets of characteristic examples, to
which many more might be added. It would be comparatively easy,
with some imagination and a conscientious neglect of evidence, to
connect the greater number of our surnames with the
Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Thus <i>Honeyball</i> might very well represent the Anglo-Sax.
Hunbeald, but, in the absence of links, it is better to regard it
as a popular perversion of Hannibal (Chapter VIII). In dealing
with this subject, the <i>via</i> <i>media</i> <i>is</i> the safe
one, and one cannot pass in one stride from Hengist and Horsa to
the Reformation period.</p>

</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">But this is the poet's point of
view. Though there may have been "no <i>Wragg</i> by the

<i>Ragg</i>, it is the first element of the heroic Ragnar, and
probably unrelated to <i>Raggett</i>, which is the medieval
<i>le</i> <i>ragged</i>. <i>Bugg</i>, which one family exchanged
for Norfolk Howard, is the Anglo-Saxon Bucgo, a name no doubt
borne by many a valiant warrior. <i>Stiggins</i>, as we have seen
(Chapter XIII), goes back to a name great in history, and
<i>Higginbottom</i> (Chapter XII) is purely
geographical.</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">It is natural that many
favourite names should be taken from those of heroes of romance
whose exploits were sung all over Europe by wandering minstrels.
Such names, including those taken from the Round Table legends,
usually came to us through French, though a few names of the
British heroes are Welsh, e.g. <i>Cradock</i> from Caradoc
(Caractacus) and <i>Maddox</i> from Madoc.</font></p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80738" id="Toc80738">THE ROUND
TABLE</a></b></p>
<p>But the Round Table stories were versified much later than the
true Old French <i>Chansons</i> <i>de</i> <i>Geste</i>, which had
a basis in the national history, and not many of Arthur's knights
are immortalized as surnames. We have <i>Tristram</i>,
<i>Lancelot</i>, whence <i>Lance</i>, <i>Percival</i>, Gawain in
<i>Gavin</i>, and <i>Kay</i>. But the last named is, like
<i>Key</i>, more usually from the word we now spell "quay,"
though <i>Key</i> and <i>Keys</i> can also be shop-signs, as of
course <i>Crosskeys</i> is. <i>Linnell</i> is sometimes for
Lionel, as <i>Neil</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> But the Scottish Neil
is a Gaelic name often exchanged for the unrelated Nigel.<i>]</i>
<i>Neal</i> for Nigel. The ladies have fared better.
<i>Vivian</i>, which is sometimes from the masculine Vivien, is
found in Dorset as <i>Vye</i>, and Isolt and Guinevere, which
long survived as font-names in Cornwall, have given several
names. From Isolt come <i>Isard</i>, <i>Isitt</i>, <i>Izzard</i>,
<i>Izod</i>, and many other forms, while Guinever appears as
<i>Genever</i>, <i>Jennifer</i>, <i>Gaynor</i>, <i>Gilliver</i>,
<i>Gulliver</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> There is also an Old Fr.
Gulafre which will account for some of the Gullivers.<i>]</i> and
perhaps also as <i>Juniper</i>. It is probably also the source of
<i>Genn</i> and <i>Ginn</i>, though these may come also from
Eugenia or from Jane. The later prose versions of the Arthurian
stories, such as those of Malory, are full of musical and
picturesque names like those used by Mr. Maurice Hewlett, but
this artificial nomenclature has left no traces in our
surnames.</p>
<p>Of the paladins the most popular was Roland or Rowland, who
survives as <i>Rowe</i>, <i>Rowlinson</i>, <i>Rolls</i>,
<i>Rollit</i>, etc., sometimes coalescing with the derivations of
Raoul, another epic hero. Gerin or Geri gave <i>Jeary</i>, and
<i>Oates</i> is the nominative (Chapter VIII) of Odo, an
important Norman name. Berenger appears as <i>Barringer</i> and
<i>Bellinger</i> (Chapter III). The simple <i>Oliver</i> is
fairly common, but it also became the Cornish <i>Olver</i>. But
perhaps the largest surname family connected with the paladins is
derived from the Breton Ives or Ivon <i>[Footnote:</i> A number
of Old French names had an accusative in -<i>on</i> <i>or</i>
-<i>ain</i>. Thus we find <i>Otes</i>, <i>Oton</i>, <i>Ives</i>,
<i>Ivain</i>, and feminines such as <i>Ide</i>, <i>Idain</i>, all
of which survive as English surnames.<i>]</i> whose name appears
in that of two English towns. It is the same as Welsh Evan, and
the Yvain of the Arthurian legends, and has given us <i>Ives</i>,
<i>Ivison</i>, <i>Ivatts</i>, <i>etc</i>. The modern surname
<i>Ivory</i> <i>is</i> usually an imitative form of <i>Every</i>
or <i>Avery</i> <i>(p</i>, <i>82)</i>. Gerard has a variety of
forms in <i>Ger</i>- and <i>Gar</i>-, <i>Jer</i>and <i>Jar</i>-
(see <i>p</i>.<i>32)</i>. The others do not seem to have
survived, except the redoubtable Archbishop <i>Turpin</i>, whose
fame is probably less than that of his namesake Dick.</p>
<p>Besides the paladins, there are many heroes of Old French epic
whose names were popular during the two centuries that followed
the Conquest. Ogier le Danois, who also fought at Roncevaux, has
given us <i>Odgers;</i> Fierabras occasionally crops up as
<i>Fairbrass</i>, <i>Firebrace;</i> Aimeri de Narbonne, from
Almaric, <i>[Footnote:</i> A metathesis of Amalric, which is
found in Anglo-Saxon.<i>]</i> whence Ital. Amerigo, is in English
<i>Amery</i>, <i>Emery</i>, <i>Imray</i>, etc.; Renaud de
Montauban is represented by <i>Reynolds</i> (Chapter VII) and
<i>Reynell</i>.</p>
<p>The famous <i>Doon</i> de Mayence may have been an ancestor of
Lorna, and the equally famous Garin, or Warin, de Monglane has
given us <i>Gearing</i>, <i>Gearing</i>, <i>Waring</i>, sometimes
<i>Warren</i>, and the diminutives <i>Garnett</i> and
<i>Warnett</i>. Milo, of Greek origin, became <i>Miles</i>, with
dim. <i>Millett</i>, but the chief origin of the surname
<i>Miles</i> <i>is</i> a contracted form of the common font-name
Michael. Amis and Amiles were the David and Jonathan of Old
French epic and the former survives as <i>Ames</i>, <i>Amies</i>,
and <i>Amos</i>, the last an imitative form.</p>
<p>We have also <i>Berner</i> from Bernier, <i>Bartram</i> from
Bertran, <i>Farrant</i> from Fernand, Terry and <i>Terriss</i>
from Thierry, the French form of Ger. Dietrich (Theodoric),
which, through Dutch, has given also <i>Derrick</i>. Garner, from
Ger. Werner, is our <i>Garner</i> <i>an</i>d <i>Warner</i>,
though these have other origins (pp. 154, 185). Dru, from Drogo,
has given <i>Drew</i>, with dim. <i>Druitt</i> (Chapter V), and
<i>Druce</i>, though the latter may also come from the town of
Dreux. <i>Walrond</i> and <i>Waldron</i> are for Waleran, usually
Galeran, and King Pippin had a retainer named <i>Morant</i>.
Saint Leger, or Leodigarius, appears as <i>Ledger</i>,
<i>Ledgard</i>, <i>etc</i>., and sometimes in the shortened
<i>Legg</i>. Among the heroines we have <i>Orbell</i> from
Orable, while Blancheflour may have suggested <i>Lillywhite;</i>
but the part played by women in <i>the</i> <i>Chansons</i>
<i>de</i> <i>Geste</i> was insignificant.</p>

<p>As this element in our nomenclature has hitherto received no
attention, it may be well to add a few more examples of names
which occur very frequently in the <i>Chansons</i> <i>de</i>
<i>Geste</i> and which have undoubted representatives in modern
English. <i>Allard</i> was one of the Four Sons of Aymon. The
name is etymologically identical with <i>Aylward</i> (Chapter
VII), but in the above form has reached us through French. Acard
or Achard is represented by <i>Haggard</i>, <i>Haggett</i>, and
<i>Hatchard</i>, <i>Hatchett</i>, though <i>Haggard</i> probably
has another origin (Chapter XXIII). <i>Harness</i> <i>is</i>
imitative for Harnais, Herneis. <i>Clarabutt</i> <i>is</i> for
Clarembaut; cf. <i>Archbutt</i> for Archembaut, the Old French
form of Archibald, <i>Archbold</i>. <i>Durrant</i> is Durand,
still a very common French surname. <i>Ely</i> is Old Fr.
&Eacute;lie, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. Elias (Chapter IX), which had the
dim. Elyot. <i>[Footnote:</i> For other names belonging to this
group see Chapter IX.<i>]</i> We also find Old Fr. Helye, whence
our <i>Healey</i>. Enguerrand is telescoped to <i>Ingram</i>,
though this may also come from the English form Ingelram.
<i>Fawkes</i> is the Old Fr. Fauques, nominative (Chapter VIII)
of Faucon, <i>i.e</i>. falcon. <i>Galpin</i> is contracted from
<i>Galopin</i>, a famous epic thief, but it may also come from
the common noun <i>galopin</i>&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">In either case it means a
"runner." <i>Henfrey</i> is from Heinfrei or Hainfroi, identical
with Anglo-Sax. Haganfrith, and <i>Manser</i> from Manesier.
<i>Neame</i> (Chapter XXI) may sometimes represent Naime, the
Nestor of Old French epic and the sage counsellor of Charlemagne.
<i>Richer</i>, from Old Fr. Richier, has generally been absorbed
by the cognate Richard. <i>Aubrey</i> and <i>Avery</i> are from
Alberic, cognate with Anglo-Sax. AElfric. An unheroic name like

Seguin.</font></p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80740" id="Toc80740">ANTIQUE NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Nor are the heroes of antiquity altogether absent. Along with
Old French national and Arthurian epics there were a number of
romances based on the legends of Alexander, Caesar, and the tale
of Troy. Alexander, or <i>Saunder</i>, was the favourite among
this class of names, especially in Scotland. <i>Cayzer</i> was
generally a nickname (Chapter XIII), its later form <i>Cesar</i>
being due to Italian influence, <i>[Footnote:</i> Julius Cesar,
physician to Queen Elizabeth, was a Venetian (Bardsley).<i>]</i>
and the same applies to <i>Hannibal</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> But
the frequent occurrence of this name and its corruptions in
Cornwall suggests that it may really have been introduced by
Carthaginian sailors.<i>]</i> when it is not an imitative form of
the female name Annabel, also corrupted into <i>Honeyball</i>.
Both Dionisius and Dionisia were once common, and have survived
as <i>Dennis</i>, <i>Dennett</i>, <i>Denny</i>, and from the
shortened <i>Dye</i> we get <i>Dyson</i>. But this Dionisius was
the patron saint of France. Apparent names of heathen gods and
goddesses are almost always due to folk-etymology, e.g.
<i>Bacchus</i> is for <i>back</i>-<i>house</i> or
<i>bake</i>-<i>house</i>, and the ancestors of Mr. Wegg's friend
<i>Venus</i> came from Venice.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80742" id="Toc80742">OLD TESTAMENT
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>The use of biblical names as font-names does not date from the
Puritans, nor are surnames derived from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
necessarily Jewish. The Old Testament names which were most
popular among the medieval peasants from whom we nearly all
spring were naturally those connected with the most picturesque
episodes of sacred history. Taking as an example the father of
all men, we find derived from the name <i>Adam</i> the following:
<i>Adams</i>, <i>Adamson</i>, <i>Adcock</i>, <i>Addis</i>,
<i>Addison</i>, <i>Adds</i>, <i>Addy</i>, <i>Ade</i>,
<i>Ades</i>, <i>Adey</i>, <i>Adis</i>, <i>Ady</i>, <i>Addey</i>,
<i>Aday</i>, <i>Adee</i>, <i>Addyman</i>, <i>Adkin</i>,
<i>Adkins</i>, <i>Adkinson</i>, <i>Adnett</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i>
Adenet (little Adam) le Roi was an Old French epic hero.<i>]</i>
<i>Adnitt</i>, <i>Adnet</i>, <i>Adnot</i>, <i>Atkin</i>,
<i>Atkins</i>, <i>Atkinson</i>, and the northern <i>Aitken</i>,
etc. This list, compiled from Bardsley's <i>Dictionary</i>
<i>of</i> <i>Surnames</i>, is certainly not exhaustive. Probably
<i>Taddy</i> is rimed on Addy as <i>Taggy</i> is on Aggy (Agnes).
To put together all the derivatives of John or Thomas would be a
task almost beyond the wit of man. Names in <i>Abb</i>-,
<i>App</i>-, may come from either Abraham or Abel, and from
<i>Abbs</i> we also have <i>Nabbs</i>. Cain was of course
unpopular. <i>Cain</i>, <i>Cane</i>, <i>Kain</i>, when not Manx,
is from the town of Caen or from Norman <i>qu&ecirc;ne</i>, an
oak.</p>
<p>Moses appears in the French form <i>Moyes</i> (Mo&iuml;se) as
early as 1273, and still earlier as <i>Moss</i>. Of the
patriarchs the favourites were perhaps Jacob and Joseph, the name
<i>Jessop</i> from the latter having been influenced by Ital.
Giuseppe. Benjamin has sometimes given <i>Benson</i> and
<i>Bennett</i>, but these are generally for Benedict (Chapter
IV). The Judges are poorly represented, except <i>Samson</i>, a
name which has obviously coalesced with the derivatives of
Samuel. David had, of course, an immense vogue, especially in
Wales (for some of its derivatives see Chapter VI), and Solomon
was also popular, the modern <i>Salmon</i> not always being a
Jewish name.</p>
<p>But almost the favourite Old Testament name was Elijah, Elias,
which, usually through its Old French form &Eacute;lie, whence
<i>Ely</i>, is the parent of <i>Ellis</i>, <i>Elliot</i>, and
many other names in <i>El</i>-, some of which, however, have to
be shared with Ellen and Alice (Chapter X). Job was also popular,
and is easily recognized in <i>Jobson</i>, <i>Jobling</i>,
<i>etc</i>., but less easily in <i>Chubb</i> (Chapter III) and
<i>Jupp</i>. The intermediate form was the obsolete Joppe. Among
the prophetic writers Daniel was an easy winner, <i>Dann</i>,
<i>Dance</i> (Chapter I), <i>Dannatt</i>, <i>Dancock</i>, etc.
<i>Balaam</i> is an imitative spelling of the local Baylham.</p>
<p>In considering these Old Testament names it must be remembered
that the people did not possess the Bible in the vernacular. The
teaching of the parish priests made them familiar with selected
episodes, from which they naturally took the names which appeared
to contain the greatest element of holiness or of warlike renown.
It is probable that the mystery plays were not without influence;
for the personal name was not always a fixed quantity, and many
of the names mentioned in the preceding paragraph may have been
acquired rather on the medieval stage than at the font.</p>
<p>This would apply with still more force to names taken from the
legends of saints and martyrs on which the miracle plays were
based. We even find the names <i>Saint</i>, <i>Martyr</i> and
<i>Postill</i>, the regular aphetic form of apostle (Chapter
III), just as we find <i>King</i> and <i>Pope</i>. Camden,
speaking of the freedom with which English names are formed,
quotes a Dutchman, who&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">"When he heard of
English men called God and Devil, said, that the English borrowed
names from all things whatsoever, good or bad."</font></p>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The medieval name Godde may of
course be for <i>Good</i>, Anglo-Sax. Goda, but <i>Ledieu</i> is
common enough in France. The name seems to be obsolete, unless it
is disguised as <i>Goad</i>. The occurrence in medieval rolls of
<i>Diabolus</i> and <i>le</i> <i>Diable</i> shows that
<i>Deville</i> need not always be for de Eyville. There was
probably much competition for this important part, and the name
would not be always felt as uncomplimentary. Among German
surnames we find not only <i>Teufel</i>, but also the compounds
<i>Manteufel</i> and <i>Teufelskind</i>.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80743" id="Toc80743">NEW TESTAMENT
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Coming to the New Testament, we find the four Evangelists
strongly represented, especially the first and last. Matthew
appears not only in an easily recognizable form, e.g. in
<i>Matheson</i>, but also as <i>Mayhew</i> and <i>Mayo</i>, Old
Fr. Mahieu. From the latter form we have the shortened <i>May</i>
and <i>Mee</i>, whence <i>Mayes</i>, <i>Makins</i>,
<i>Meakin</i>, <i>Meeson</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> One family of
<i>Meeson</i> claims descent from <i>Malvoisin</i>.<i>]</i> and
sometimes <i>Mason</i>. Mark is one of the sources of
<i>March</i> (p, 90), as Luke is of <i>Luck</i>, whence
<i>Lucock</i>, <i>Luckett</i>, <i>etc</i>, though we more often
find the learned form Lucas.</p>
<p>Of John there is no need to speak. Of the apostles the great
favourites, Simon, or Peter, John, and Bartholomew have already
been mentioned. Almost equally popular was Philip, whence
<i>Philp</i>, <i>Phipps</i>, <i>Phelps</i>, and the dim.
<i>Philpot</i>, whence the aphetic <i>Pott</i>, <i>Potts</i>.
Andrew flourished naturally in Scotland, its commonest derivative
being <i>Anderson</i>, while <i>Dendy</i> is for the rimed form
Dandy. Paul has of course had a great influence and is
responsible for <i>Pawson</i> or <i>Porson</i>, <i>Pawling</i>,
<i>Polson</i>, <i>Pollett</i>, and most names in Pol-.
<i>[Footnote:</i> This does not of course apply to Cornish names
in <i>Pol</i>- (Chapter VI)<i>]</i> It is also, in the form
<i>Powell</i>, assimilated to the Welsh Ap Howel. Paul is
regularly spelt Poule by Chaucer, and St. Paul's Cathedral is
often called <i>Powles</i> in Tudor documents. Paul's companions
are poorly represented, for <i>Barnby</i> is local, while names
in <i>Sil</i>- and <i>Sel</i>- come from shortened form of Cecil,
Cecilia, and Silvester. Another great name from the Acts of the
Apostles is that of the protomartyr Stephen, among the numerous
derivatives of which we must include <i>Stennett</i> and
<i>Stimpson</i>.</p>
<p>Many non-biblical saints whose names occur very frequently
have already been mentioned, e.g. Antony, Bernard, Gregory,
Martin, Lawrence, Nicholas, etc To these may be added Augustine,
or <i>Austin</i>, Christopher, or Kit, with the dim.
<i>Christie</i> and the patronymic <i>Kitson</i>, Clement, whence
a large family of names <i>in</i> <i>Clem</i>-, Gervase or
<i>Jarvis</i>, Jerome, sometimes represented by <i>Jerram</i>,
and Theodore or <i>Tidd</i> (cf. <i>Tibb</i> fron Theobald), who
becomes in Welsh <i>Tudor</i>. Vincent has given <i>Vince</i>,
<i>Vincey</i> and <i>Vincett</i>, and <i>Baseley</i>,
<i>Blazey</i> are from Basil and Blaine. The Anglo-Saxon saints
are poorly represented, though probably most of them survive in a
disguised form, e.g. <i>Price</i> is sometimes for <i>Brice</i>,
Cuthbert has sometimes given <i>Cubitt</i> and <i>Cobbett</i>,
and also <i>Cutts</i>. <i>Bottle</i> sometimes represents Botolf,
<i>Neate</i> <i>may</i> be for Neot, and Chad (Ceadda) survives
as <i>Chatt</i> and in many local names. The Cornish
<i>Tangye</i> is from the Breton St. Tanneguy. The Archangel
Michael has given one of our commonest names, <i>Mitchell</i>
(Chapter IV). This is through French, but we have also the
contracted <i>Miall</i>&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
"At Michael's term had many a <i>trial</i>,<br>

<p>This name exists in several other forms, e.g. <i>Mihell</i>,
<i>Myhill</i>, <i>Mighill</i>, and most frequently of all as
<i>Miles</i> (Chapter VIII). The reader will remember the famous
salient of Saint-Mihiel, on the Meuse, held by the Germans for so
long a period of the war. From Gabriel we have <i>Gabb</i>,
<i>Gabbett</i>, <i>etc</i>. The common rustic pronunciation
<i>Gable</i> has given <i>Cable</i> (Chapter III).</p>
<p>Among female saints we find Agnes, pronounced <i>Annis</i>,
the derivatives of which have become confused with those of Anne,
or Nan, Catherine, whence <i>Call</i>, <i>Catlin</i>, etc.,
Cecilia, Cicely, whence <i>Sisley</i>, and of course Mary and
Margaret. For these see Chapter X. St. Bride, or Bridget,
survives in <i>Kirkbride</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80744" id="Toc80744">FEAST-DAYS</a></b></p>
<p>A very interesting group of surnames are derived from
font-names taken from the great feasts of the Church, date of
birth or baptism, etc. <i>[Footnote:</i> Names of this class were
no doubt also sometimes given to foundlings.<i>]</i> These are
more often French or Greco-Latin than English, a fact to be
explained by priestly influence. Thus <i>Christmas</i> is much
less common than <i>Noel</i> or <i>Nowell</i>, but we also find
<i>Midwinter</i> (Chapter II) and <i>Yule</i>. <i>Easter</i> has
a local origin (from a place in Essex) and also represents Mid.
Eng. es<i>tre</i>, a word of very vague meaning for part of a
building, originally the exterior, from Lat. <i>extra</i>. It
survives in Fr. <i>les</i> <i>&ecirc;tres</i> <i>d'une</i>
<i>maison</i>. <i>Hester</i>, to which Bardsley gives the same
origin, I should rather connect with Old Fr. <i>hestre</i>
<i>(h&ecirc;tre)</i>, a beech. However that may be, the Easter
festival is represented in our surnames by <i>Pascall</i>,
Cornish <i>Pascoe</i>, and <i>Pask</i>, <i>Pash</i>, <i>Pace</i>,
<i>Pack</i>.</p>
<p><i>Patch</i>, formerly a nickname for a jester (Chapter XX),
from his motley clothes, is also sometimes a variant of
<i>Pash</i>. And the dim. <i>Patchett</i> has become confused
with <i>Padgett</i>, from Padge, a rimed form of Madge.
<i>Pentecost</i> is recorded as a personal name in Anglo-Saxon
times. Michaelmas is now <i>Middleman</i> (Chapter III), and
<i>Tiffany</i> is an old name for Epiphany. It comes from
Greco-Latin <i>theophania</i> (while Epiphany represents
<i>epiphania)</i>, which gave the French female name Tiphaine,
whence our <i>Tiffin</i>. <i>Lammas</i> (loaf mass) is also found
as a personal name, but there is a place called Lammas in
Norfolk. We have compounds of <i>day</i> in <i>Halliday</i> or
<i>Holiday</i>, <i>Hay</i>-<i>day</i>, for high day,
<i>Loveday</i>, a day appointed for reconciliations, and
<i>Hockaday</i>, for a child born during Hocktide, which begins
on the 15th day after Easter. It was also called Hobday, though
it is hard to say why; hence the name <i>Hobday</i>, unless this
is to be taken as the <i>day</i>, or servant (Chapter XIX), in
the service of Hob; cf. <i>Hobman</i>.</p>
<p>The days of the week are puzzling, the only one at all common
being <i>Munday</i>, though most of the others are found in
earlier nomenclature. We should rather expect special attention
to be given to Sunday and Friday, and, in fact, Sonntag and
Freytag are by far the most usual in German, while Dimanche and
its perversions are common in France, and Vendredi also occurs.
This makes me suspect some other origin, probably local, for
<i>Munday</i>, the more so as Fr. Dimanche, Demange, etc., is
often for the personal name Dominicus, the etymology remaining
the same as that of the day-name, the Lord's day. Parts of the
day seem to survive in <i>Noon</i>, <i>Eve</i>, and
<i>Morrow</i>, but <i>Noon</i> <i>is</i> local, Fr. Noyon (cf.
<i>Moon</i>, earlier <i>Mohun</i>, from Moyon), <i>Eve</i>
<i>is</i> the mother of mankind, and <i>Morrow</i> is for
<i>moor</i>-<i>wro</i>, the second element being Mid. Eng.
<i>wra</i>, comer, whence <i>Wray</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80745" id="Toc80745">MONTH NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>We find the same difficulty with the names of the months.
Several of these are represented in French, but our <i>March</i>
has four other origins, from March in Cambridgeshire, from march,
a boundary, from marsh, or from Mark; while <i>May</i> means in
Mid. English a maiden (Chapter XXI), and is also a dim. of
Matthew (Chapter IX). The names of the seasons also present
difficulty. <i>Spring</i> usually corresponds to Fr. La Fontaine
(Chapter II), but we find also <i>Lent</i>, the old name for the
season, and French has <i>Printemps</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> The
cognate Ger. <i>Lenz</i> is fairly common, hence the frequency of
<i>Lent</i> in America.<i>]</i> <i>Summer</i> and <i>Winter</i>
<i>[Footnote:</i> Winter was one of Hereward's most faithful
comrades.<i>]</i> are found very early as nicknames, as are also
<i>Frost</i> and <i>Snow</i>; but why always <i>Summers</i> or
<i>Somers</i> with <i>s</i> and <i>Winter</i> without?
<i>[Footnote:</i> Two other common nicknames were <i>Flint</i>
and <i>Steel</i>.<i>]</i> The latter has no doubt in many cases
absorbed <i>Vinter</i>, vintner (Chapter III) but this will not
account for the complete absence of genitive forms. And what has
become of the other season? We should not expect to find the
learned word "autumn," but neither <i>Fall</i> nor
<i>Harvest</i>, the true English equivalents, are at all common
as surnames.</p>
<p>I regard this group, viz. days, months, seasons, as one of the
least clearly accounted for in our nomenclature, and cannot help
thinking that the more copious examples which we find in French
and German are largely distorted forms due to the imitative
instinct, or are susceptible of other explanations. This is
certainly true in some cases, e.g. Fr. Mars is the regular French
development of Medardus, a saint to whom a well-known Parisian
church is dedicated; and the relationship of Janvier to Janus may
be <i>via</i> the Late Lat. <i>januarius</i>, for <i>janitor</i>,
a doorkeeper.</p>
<p><i>[Footnote:</i> Medardus was the saint who, according to
Ingoldsby, lived largely on oysters obtained by the Red Sea
shore. At his church in Paris were performed the 'miracles' of
the Quietists in the seventeenth century. When the scenes that
took place became a scandal, the government intervened, with the
result that a wag adorned the church door with the following:</p>

His views have been subjected to much ignorant criticism by
writers who, taking upon themselves the task of defending
medieval virtue, have been unwilling to accept this terrible
picture of the moral condition of England, etc. This anxiety is
misplaced. There are many reasons, besides illegitimacy, for the
adoption of the mother's name. In medieval times the children of
a widow, especially posthumous children, would often assume the
mother's name. <i>Widdowson</i> itself is sufficiently common. In
the case of second marriages the two families might sometimes be
distinguished by their mothers' names. Orphans would be adopted
by female relatives, and a medieval Mrs. Joe Gargery would
probably have impressed her own name rather than that of her
husband on a medieval Pip. In a village which counted two Johns
or Williams, and few villages did not, the children of one might
assume, or rather would be given by the public voice, the
mother's name. Finally, metronymics can be collected in hundreds
by anyone who cares to work through a few early
registers.</font></p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80747" id="Toc80747">FEMALE
FONT-NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Thus, in the Lancashire Inquests 205-1307 occur plenty of
people described as the sons of Alice, Beatrice, Christiana, Eda,
Eva, Mariot, Matilda, Quenilda, <i>[Footnote:</i> An Anglo-Saxon
name, Cynehild, whence <i>Quennell</i>.<i>]</i> Sibilla, Ysolt.
Even if illegitimacy were the only reason, that would not concern
the philologist.</p>
<p>Female names undergo the same course of treatment as male
names. Mary gave the diminutives Marion and Mariot, whence
<i>Marriott</i>. <i>It</i> was popularly shortened into Mal (cf.
Hal for Harry), which had the diminutive Mally. From these we
have <i>Mawson</i> <i>and</i> <i>Malleson</i>, the former also
belonging to Maud. Mal and Mally became Mol and Molly, hence
Mollison. The rimed forms Pol, Polly are later, and names in
<i>Pol</i>- usually belong to Paul (Chapter IX). The name
<i>Morris</i> has three other origins (the font-name Maurice, the
nickname Moorish, and the local <i>marsh)</i>, but both
<i>Morris</i> and <i>Morrison</i> are sometimes to be referred to
Mary. Similarly Margaret, popularly Mar-get, became Mag, Meg,
Mog, whence <i>Meggitt</i>, <i>Moxon</i>, <i>etc</i>. The rarity
of <i>Maggot</i> <i>is</i> easily understood, but Poll Maggot was
one of Jack Sheppard's accomplices and Shakespeare uses
<i>maggot</i>-<i>pie</i> for magpie <i>(Macbeth</i>, <i>iii</i>,
<i>4)</i>. Meg was rimed into Peg, whence <i>Peggs</i>, Mog into
Pog, whence <i>Pogson</i>, and Madge into Padge, whence
<i>Padgett</i>, when this is not for <i>Patchett</i> (Chapter
IX), or for the Fr. <i>Paget</i>, usually explained as
<i>Smallpage</i>. The royal name Matilda appears in the
contracted <i>Maud</i>, <i>Mould</i>, <i>Moule</i>, <i>Mott</i>,
<i>Mahood</i> (Old Fr. Maheut). Its middle syllable <i>Till</i>
gave <i>Tilly</i>, <i>Tillson</i> and the dim. <i>Tillet</i>,
<i>Tillot</i>, whence <i>Tillotson</i>. From Beatrice we have
<i>Bee</i>, <i>Beaton</i> and <i>Betts</i>, and the northern
<i>Beattie</i>, which are not connected with the great name
Elizabeth. This is in medieval rolls represented by its cognate
Isabel, of which the shortened form was <i>Bell</i> (Chapter I),
or Ib, the latter giving <i>Ibbot</i>, <i>Ibbotson</i>, and the
rimed forms <i>Tib</i>-, <i>Nib</i>-, <i>Bib</i>-, <i>Lib</i>-.
Here also belong <i>Ebbs</i> and <i>Epps</i> rather than to the
Anglo-Sax. Ebba (Chapter VII).</p>
<p>Many names which would now sound somewhat ambitious were
common among the medieval peasantry and are still found in the
outlying parts of England, especially Devon and Cornwall. Among
the characters in Mr. Eden Phillpotts's <i>Widecombe</i>
<i>Fair</i> are two sisters named <i>Sibley</i> and
<i>Petronell</i>. From Sibilla, now Sibyl, come most names in
<i>Sib</i>-, though this was used also as a dim. of Sebastian
(see also Chapter VII), while Petronilla, has given
<i>Parnell</i>, <i>Purnell</i>. As a female name it suffered the
eclipse to which certain names are accidentally subject, and
became equivalent to wench. References to a "prattling Parnel"
are common in old writers, and the same fate overtook it in
French&mdash;</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Mention has already been made
of the survival of Guinevere (Chapter VIII). From Cassandra we
have <i>Cash</i>, <i>Cass</i>, <i>Case</i>, and <i>Casson</i>,

were no doubt confused with the derivatives of Ida. William
filius Idae is in the Fine Rolls of John's reign, and John
Idonyesone occurs there, temp. Edward I. <i>Pim</i>, as a female
font-name, may be from Euphemia, and <i>Siddons</i> appears to
belong to Sidonia, while the pretty name Avice appears as
<i>Avis</i> and <i>Haweis</i>. From Lettice, Lat.
<i>laetitia</i>, joy, we have <i>Letts</i>, <i>Lettson</i>, while
the corresponding <i>Joyce</i>, Lat. <i>jocosa</i>, merry, has
become confused with Fr. Josse (Chapter I). <i>Anstey</i>,

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80748" id="Toc80748">DOUBTFUL CASES</a></b></p>
<p>It is often difficult to separate patronymics from
metronymics. We have already seen (Chapter VI) that names in
<i>Ed</i>- may be from Eda or from Edward, while names in
<i>Gil</i>- must be shared between Julian, Juliana, Guillaume,
Gilbert, and Giles. There are many other cases like Julian and
Juliana, e.g. <i>Custance</i> is for Constance, but <i>Cust</i>
may also represent the masculine Constant, while among the
derivatives of Philip we must not forget the warlike Philippa.
Or, to take pairs which are unrelated, <i>Kitson</i> may be from
Christopher or from Catherine, and <i>Mattison</i> from Matthew
or from Martha, which became Matty and Patty, the derivatives of
the latter coalescing with those of Patrick (Chapter VI). It is
obvious that the derivatives of Alice would be confused with
those of Allen, while names in <i>El</i>- may represent Elias or
Eleanor. Also names in <i>Al</i>- and <i>El</i>- are sometimes
themselves confused, e.g. the Anglo-Saxon AElfgod appears both as
<i>Allgood</i> and <i>Elgood</i>. More <i>Nelsons</i> are derived
from Neil, <i>i.e</i>. Nigel, than from Nell, the rimed dim. of
Ellen. <i>Emmett</i> is a dim. of Emma, but <i>Empson</i>
<i>may</i> be a shortened <i>Emerson</i> from Emery (Chapter
VIII). The rather commonplace <i>Tibbles</i> stands for both
Theobald and Isabella, and the same is true of all names in
<i>Tib</i>- and some in Teb-. Lastly, the coalescence of John,
the commonest English font-name, with Joan, the earlier form of
Jane, was inevitable, while the French forms Jean and Jeanne
would be undistinguishable in their derivatives. These names
between them have given an immense number of surnames, the
masculine or feminine interpretation of which must be left to the
reader's imagination.</p>

</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">There is an idea cherished by
some people that the possession of a surname which is that of a
village or other locality points to ancestral ownership of that
region. This is a delusion. In the case of quite small features
of the landscape, e.g. <i>Bridge</i>, <i>Hill</i>, the name was
given from place of residence. But in the case of counties, towns
and villages, the name was usually acquired when the locality was
left. Thus John Tiler leaving Acton, perhaps for Acton's good,
would be known in his new surroundings as John Acton. A moment's
reflection will show that this must be so. <i>Scott</i> <i>is</i>
an English name, the aristocratic Scotts beyond the border
representing a Norman family Escot, originally of Scottish
origin. <i>English</i>, early spelt <i>Inglis</i>, is a Scottish
name. The names <i>Cornish</i> and <i>Cornwallis</i> first became
common in Devonshire, as <i>Devenish</i> did outside that county.
<i>French</i> and <i>Francis</i>, Old Fr. <i>le</i>
<i>franceis</i>, are English names, just as <i>Langlois</i>
<i>(</i>l'Anglais) is common in France. For the same reason
<i>Cutler</i> is a rare name in Sheffield, where all are cutlers.
By exception the name <i>Curnow</i>, which is Cornish for a
Cornishman, is fairly common in its native county, but it was
perhaps applied especially to those inhabitants who could only
speak the old Cornish language.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80750" id="Toc80750">CLASSES OF LOCAL
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>The local name may range in origin from a country to a plant
<i>(France</i>, <i>Darbishire</i>, <i>Lankester</i>,
<i>Ashby</i>, <i>Street</i>, <i>House</i>, <i>Pound</i>,
<i>Plumptre</i>, <i>Daisy)</i>, and, mathematically stated, the
size of the locality will vary in direct proportion to the
distance from which the immigrant has come. Terentius Afer was
named from a continent. I cannot find a parallel in England, but
names such as the nouns <i>France</i>, <i>Ireland</i>,
<i>Pettingell</i> (Portugal), or the adjectives <i>Dench</i>,
Mid. Eng. <i>dense</i>, Danish, <i>Norman</i>, <i>Welsh</i>,
<i>(Walsh</i>, <i>Wallis</i>, etc.), <i>Allman</i> (Allemand),
often perverted to <i>Almond</i>, were considered a sufficient
mark of identification for men who came from foreign parts. But
the untravelled inhabitant, if distinguished by a local name,
would often receive it from some very minute feature of the
landscape, e.g. Solomon <i>Daisy</i> may have been descended from
a Robert <i>Dayeseye</i>, who lived in Hunts in 1273. It is not
very easy to see how such very trifling surnames as this last
came into existence, but its exiguity is surpassed in the case of
a prominent French airman who bears the appropriately buoyant
name of <i>Brindejonc</i>, perhaps from some ancestor who
habitually chewed a straw.</p>
<p>An immense number of our countrymen are simply named from the
points of the compass, slightly disguised in <i>Norris</i>,
Anglo-Fr. <i>le</i> <i>noreis</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> The
corresponding <i>le</i> <i>surreis</i> <i>is</i> now represented
by <i>Surridge</i>.<i>]</i> <i>Sotheran</i>, the southron, and
<i>Sterling</i>, for Easterling, a name given to the Hanse
merchants. <i>Westray</i> was formerly <i>le</i> <i>westreis</i>.
A German was to our ancestors, as he still is to sailors, a
Dutchman, whence our name <i>Douch</i>, Ger. <i>deutsch</i>, Old
High Ger. <i>tiutisc</i>, which, through Old French <i>tieis</i>,
has given <i>Tyas</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Tyars</i>, or
<i>Tyers</i>, which Bardsley puts with this, seems to be rather
Fr. <i>Thiers</i>, Lat. t<i>ertius</i>.<i>]</i></p>
<p>But not every local name is to be taken at its face value.
<i>Holland</i> is usually from one of the Lancashire Hollands,
and <i>England</i> may be for Mid. Eng. <i>ing</i>-<i>land</i>,
the land of Ing (cf. Ingulf, Ingold, etc.), a personal name which
is the first element in many place-names, or from <i>ing</i>, a
meadow by a stream. <i>Holyland</i> is not Palestine, but the
holly-land. <i>Hampshire</i> is often for Hallamshire, a district
in Yorkshire. <i>Dane</i> is a variant of Mid. Eng. <i>dene</i>,
a valley, the inhabitant of Denmark having given us <i>Dench</i>
(Chapter XI) and <i>Dennis</i> <i>(le</i> <i>daneis)</i>.
Visitors to Margate will remember the valley called the Dane,
which stretches from the harbour to St. Peters. <i>Saxon</i> is
not racial, but a perversion of sexton (Chapter XVII). Mr.
Birdofredum Sawin, commenting on the methods employed in carrying
out the great mission of the Anglo-Saxon race, remarks
that&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80751" id="Toc80751">COUNTIES AND

<p>As a rule it will be found that, while most of our counties
have given family names, sometimes corrupted, e.g.
<i>Lankshear</i>, <i>Willsher</i>, <i>Cant</i>, <i>Chant</i>, for
Kent, with which we may compare <i>Anguish</i> for Angus, the
larger towns are rather poorly represented, the movement having
always been from country to town, and the smaller spot serving
for more exact description. An exception is <i>Bristow</i>
(Bristol), Mid. Eng. <i>brig</i>-<i>stow</i>, the place on the
bridge, the great commercial city of the west from which so many
medieval seamen hailed; but the name is sometimes from Burstow
(Surrey), and there were possibly smaller places called by so
natural a name, just as the name <i>Bradford</i>, <i>i.e</i>.
broad ford, may come from a great many other places than the
Yorkshire wool town. <i>Rossiter</i> is generally for Rochester,
but also for Wroxeter (Salop); Coggeshall is well disguised as
<i>Coxall</i>, Barnstaple as <i>Bastable</i>, Maidstone as
<i>Mayston</i>, Stockport as <i>Stopford</i>. On the other hand,
there is not a village of any antiquity but has, or once had, a

<p><b><a name="Toc80752" id="Toc80752">NAMES PRECEDED <i>BY</i>
<i>DE</i></a></b></p>
<p>The provinces and towns of France and Flanders have given us
many common surnames. From names of provinces we have
<i>Burgoyne</i> and <i>Burgin</i>, <i>Champain</i> and
<i>Champneys</i> (Chapter II), <i>Gascoyne</i> and <i>Gaskin</i>,
<i>Mayne</i>, <i>Mansell</i>, Old Fr. <i>Mancel</i>
<i>(manceau)</i>, an inhabitant of Maine or of its capital Le
Mans, <i>Brett</i> and <i>Britton</i>, Fr. le Bret and le Breton,
<i>Pickard</i>, <i>Power</i>, sometimes from Old Fr.
<i>Pohier</i>, a Picard, <i>Peto</i>, formerly Peitow, from
Poitou, <i>Poidevin</i> and <i>Puddifin</i>, for</p>
<p>Poitevin, <i>Loring</i>, Old Fr. <i>le</i> <i>Lohereng</i>,
the man from Lorraine, assimilated to <i>Fleming</i>,
<i>Hammy</i>, an old name for Hainault, <i>Brabazon</i>, le
Braban&ccedil;on, and <i>Brebner</i>, formerly le Brabaner,
<i>Angwin</i>, for Angevin, <i>Flinders</i>, a perversion of
Flanders, <i>Barry</i>, which is sometimes for Berri, and others
which can be identified by everybody.</p>
<p>Among towns we have <i>Allenson</i>, Alen&ccedil;on,
<i>Amyas</i>, Amiens, <i>Ainger</i>, Angers, <i>Aris</i>, Arras,
<i>Bevis</i>, Beauvais, <i>Bullen</i>, Boulogne, <i>Bloss</i>,
Blois, <i>Bursell</i>, Brussels, <i>Callis</i> and
<i>Challis</i>, Calais, <i>Challen</i>, from one of the French
towns called Chalon or Chalons, <i>Chaworth</i>, Cahors,
<i>Druce</i>, Dreux, <i>Gaunt</i>, Gand (Ghent), <i>Luck</i>,
Luick (Liege), <i>Loving</i>, Louvain, <i>Malins</i>, Malines
(Mechlin), <i>Raynes</i>, Rennes and Rheims, <i>Roan</i>, Rouen,
<i>Sessions</i>, Soissons, <i>Stamp</i>, Old Fr. Estampes
(ttampes), <i>Turney</i>, Tournay, etc. The name de Verdun is
common enough in old records for us to connect with it both the
fascinating Dolly and the illustrious Harry. <i>[Footnote added
by scanner:</i> Some modern readers might not realise that
Weekley was referring to Harry Vardon, a famous golfer of the
late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Dolly Varden was a
character in Dickens&rsquo; "Barnaby Rudge", a pretty girl in
flowered hats and skirts. Her name was borrowed for various
clothing styles, breeds of flowers, shows, theatres and even
angling fishes among other things. There seem to have been
several references to "the fascinating Dolly Varden", though the
expression does not occur in the book.<i>]</i> To the above may
be added, among German towns, <i>Cullen</i>, Cologne, and
<i>Lubbock</i>, Luebeck, and, from Italy, <i>Janes</i>,
G&ecirc;nes (Genoa), <i>Janaway</i> or <i>Janways</i>,
<i>i.e</i>. Genoese, and <i>Lombard</i> or <i>Lombard</i>.
Familiar names of foreign towns were often anglicized. Thus we
find Hamburg called <i>Hamborough</i>, Bruges <i>Bridges</i>, and
Tours <i>Towers</i>.</p>
<p>To the town of Angers we sometimes owe, besides <i>Ainger</i>,
the forbidding names <i>Anger</i> and <i>Danger</i>. In many
local names of foreign origin the preposition <i>de</i> has been
incorporated, e.g. <i>Dalmain</i>, d'Allemagne, sometimes
corrupted into <i>Dallman</i> and <i>Dollman</i>, though these
are also for <i>Doleman</i>, from the East Anglian <i>dole</i>, a
boundary, <i>Dallison</i>, d'Alen&ccedil;on, <i>Danvers</i>,
d'Anvers, Antwerp, <i>Devereux</i>, d'&Eacute;vreux,
<i>Daubeney</i>, <i>Dabney</i>, d'Aubigny, <i>Disney</i>,
d'Isigny, etc. <i>Doyle</i> is a later form of <i>Doyley</i>, or
<i>Dolley</i>, for d'Ouilli, and <i>Darcy</i> and <i>Durfey</i>
were once d'Arcy and d'Urf&eacute;. <i>Dew</i> <i>is</i>
sometimes for de Eu. Sir John de Grey, justice of Chester, had in
1246 two <i>Alice</i> <i>in</i> <i>Wonderland</i> clerks named
Henry de Eu and William de Ho. A familiar example, which has been
much disputed, is the Cambridgeshire name <i>Death</i>, which
some of its possessors prefer to write D'Aeth or De Ath. Bardsley
rejects this, without, I think, sufficient reason. It is true
that it occurs as <i>de</i> <i>Dethe</i> in the Hundred Rolls,
but this is not a serious argument, for we find also <i>de</i>
<i>Daubeney</i> (Chapter XI), the original <i>de</i> having
already been absorbed at the time the Rolls were compiled. This
retention of the <i>de</i> is also common in names derived from
spots which have not become recognized place-names; see Chapter
XIV.</p>
<p>But to derive a name of obviously native origin from a place
in France is a snobbish, if harmless, delusion. There are quite
enough <i>moor</i> <i>leys</i> in England without explaining
<i>Morley</i> by Morlaix. To connect the Mid. English nickname
<i>Longfellow</i> with Longueville, or the patronymic
<i>Hansom</i> (Chapter III) with Anceaumville, betrays the same
belief in phonetic epilepsy that inspires the derivation of
<i>Barber</i> from the chapelry of Sainte-Barbe. The fact that
there are at least three places, in England called
<i>Carrington</i> has not prevented one writer from seeking the
origin of that name in the appropriate locality of Charenton.</p>

names, but only with the essential elements of which they are
composed, elements which were often used for surnominal purposes
long before the spot itself had developed into a village.
<i>[Footnote:</i> A good general account of our village names
will be found in the Appendix to Isaac Taylor's <i>Names</i>
<i>and</i> <i>their</i> <i>Histories</i>. It is reprinted as
chapter xi of the same author's <i>Words</i> <i>and</i>
<i>Places</i> (Everyman Library). See also Johnston's
<i>Place</i>-<i>names</i> <i>of</i> <i>England</i> and
<i>Wales</i>, a glossary of selected names with a comprehensive
introduction. There are many modern books on the village names of
various counties, e.g. Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Cambridgeshire,
Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Suffolk (Skeat), Oxfordshire
(Alexander), Lancashire (Wyld and Hirst), West Riding of
Yorkshire (Moorman), Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire
(Duignan), Nottinghamshire (Mutschmann), Gloucestershire
(Baddeley), Herefordshire (Bannister), Wiltshire (Elsblom), S.W.
Yorkshire (Goodall), Sussex (Roberts), Lancashire (Sephton),
Derbyshire (Walker), Northumberland and Durham (Mawer).<i>]</i>
Thus the name <i>Oakley</i> must generally have been borne by a
man who lived on meadow land which was surrounded or dotted with
oak-trees. But I should be shy of explaining a given village
called Oakley in the same way, because the student of place-names
might be able to show from early records that the place was
originally an <i>ey</i>, or island, and that the first syllable
is the disguised name of a medieval churl. These four simple
etymons themselves may also become perverted. Thus -<i>ham</i> is
sometimes confused with -<i>holm</i> (Chapter XII), -<i>ley</i>,
as I have just suggested, may in some cases contain -<i>ey</i>,
-<i>ton</i> occasionally interchanges with -<i>don</i> and
-<i>stone</i>, and -<i>lord</i> with the French -<i>fort</i>
(Chapter XIV).</p>
<p>In. this chapter will be found a summary of the various words
applied by our ancestors to the natural features of the land they
lived on. To avoid too lengthy a catalogue, I have classified
them under the three headings&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p>(1) Hill and Dale,</p>
<p>(2) Plain and Woodland,</p>
<p>(3) Water and Waterside,</p>
</div>
<p>reserving for the next chapter the names due to man's
interference with the scenery, e.g. roads, buildings, enclosures,
etc.</p>
<p>They are mostly Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian, the Celtic name
remaining as the appellation of the individual hill, stream, etc.
(Helvellyn, Avon, etc.). The simple word has in almost all cases
given a fairly common surname, but compounds are of course
numerous, the first element being descriptive of the second, e.g.
<i>Bradley</i>, broad lea, <i>Radley</i> and <i>Ridley</i>, red
lea, <i>Brockley</i>, brook lea or badger lea (Chapter XXIII),
<i>Beverley</i>, beaver lea, <i>Cleverley</i>, clover lea,
<i>Hawley</i>, hedge lea, <i>Rawnsley</i>, raven's lea, and so
<i>ad</i> <i>infinitum</i>. In the oldest records spot names are
generally preceded by the preposition <i>at</i>, whence such
names as <i>Attewell</i>, <i>Atwood</i>, but other prepositions
occur, as in <i>Bythesea</i>, <i>Underwood</i> and the hybrid
<i>Suttees</i>, on Tees. Cf. such French names as
<i>Doutrepont</i>, from beyond the bridge.</p>
<p>One curious phenomenon, of which I can offer no explanation,
is that while many spot names occur indifferently with or without
-<i>s</i>, e.g. <i>Bridge</i>, <i>Bridges;</i> <i>Brook</i>,
<i>Brooks;</i> <i>Platt</i>, <i>Plaits</i>, in others we find a
regular preference either for the singular or plural form.
<i>[Footnote:</i> In some cases no doubt a plural, in others a
kind of genitive due to the influence of personal names, such as
Wills, <i>Perkins</i>, <i>etc</i>.] Compare the following
couples:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><i>Field</i> <i>Meadows</i></p>
<p>Lake <i>Rivers</i></p>
<p>Pool <i>Mears</i> <i>(metes)</i></p>
<p>Spying <i>Wells</i></p>
<p>House <i>Coates</i> <i>(P</i>, 133)</p>
<p><i>Marsh</i> <i>Myers</i> (mires)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Myers</i> is very often a Jewish name,
from the very common Ger. <i>Meyer</i>, for which see Chapter
IV.<i>]</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>to which many more might be added. So we find regularly
<i>Nokes</i> but <i>Nash</i> (Chapter III), <i>Beech</i> but
<i>Willows</i>. The general tendency is certainly towards the
-<i>s</i> forms in the case of monosyllables, e.g. <i>Banks</i>,
<i>Foulds</i>, <i>Hayes</i>, <i>Stubbs</i>, <i>Thwaites</i>,
etc., but we naturally find the singular in compounds, e.g.
<i>Windebank</i> (winding), <i>Nettlefold</i>, <i>Roundhay</i>,
etc.</p>
<p>There is also a further problem offered by names in
-<i>er</i>. We know that a <i>Waller</i> was a mason or
wall-builder, but was a <i>Bridger</i> really a <i>Pontifex</i>,
<i>[Footnote:</i> An example of a Latinized name. Cf.
<i>Sutor</i>, <i>Faber</i>, and the barbarous <i>Sartorius</i>,
for <i>sartor</i>, a tailor. <i>Pontifex</i> <i>may</i> also be
the latinized form of <i>Pope</i> or <i>Bishop</i>. It is not
known why this title, bridge-builder, was given to
high-priests.<i>]</i> did he merely live near the bridge, or was
he the same as a <i>Bridgman</i>, and what was the latter? Did
Sam <i>Weller's</i> ancestor sink wells, possess a well, or live
near someone else's well? Probably all explanations may be
correct, for the suffix may have differed in meaning according to
locality, but I fancy that in most cases proximity alone is
implied. The same applies to many cases of names in -<i>man</i>,
such as <i>Hillman</i>, <i>Dickman</i> (dyke),
<i>Parkman</i>.</p>
<p>Many of the words in the following paragraphs are obsolete or
survive only in local usage. Some of them also vary considerably
in meaning, according to the region in which they are found. I
have included many which, in their simple form, seem too obvious
to need explanation, because the compounds are not always equally
clear.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80755" id="Toc80755">HILL AND DALE</a></b></p>
<p>We have a fair number of Celtic words connected with natural
scenery, but they do not as a rule form compounds, and as
surnames are usually found in their simple form. Such are
<i>Cairn</i>, a stony hill, <i>Crag</i>, <i>Craig</i>, and the
related <i>Carrick</i> and <i>Creagh</i>, <i>Glen</i> or
<i>Glynn</i>, and <i>Lynn</i>, a cascade. Two words, however, of
Celtic origin, <i>don</i>, or <i>down</i>, a hill, and
<i>combe</i>, a hollow in the hills, were adopted by the
Anglo-Saxons and enter into many compounds. Thus we find
<i>Kingdon</i>, whence the imitative <i>Kingdom</i>,
<i>Brandon</i>, from the name Brand (Chapter VII),
<i>Ashdown</i>, <i>etc</i>. The simple <i>Donne</i> <i>or</i>
<i>Dunne</i> <i>is</i> sometimes the Anglo-Saxon name Dunna,
whence <i>Dunning</i>, or a colour nickname, while <i>Down</i>
and <i>Downing</i> may represent the Anglo-Sax. Duna and Duning
(Chapter VII). From <i>Combe</i>, used especially in the west of
England, we have <i>Compton</i>, and such compounds as
<i>Acomb</i>, at combe, <i>Addiscombe</i>, <i>Battiscombe</i>,
etc. But <i>Newcomb</i> <i>is</i> for <i>Newcome</i> (Chapter
II). See also <i>Slocomb</i> (Chapter XXI).</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80756" id="Toc80756">HILLS</a></b></p>
<p>The simple <i>Hill</i> and <i>Dale</i> are among our common
surnames. <i>Hill</i> also appears as <i>Hull</i> and is easily
disguised in compounds, e.g. <i>Brummel</i> for broom-hill,
<i>Tootell</i> and <i>Tuttle</i> for Toothill, a name found in
many localities and meaning a hill on which a watch was kept. It
is connected with the verb to <i>tout</i>, originally to look
out</p>

the north country names <i>Greenhow</i>,
<i>Birchenough</i>.</font></p>
<p>This is often reduced to -<i>o</i>, as in <i>Clitheroe</i>,
<i>Shafto</i>, and is easily confused with <i>scough</i>, a wood
(Scand.), as in <i>Briscoe</i> (birch), <i>Ayscough</i>
(ash).</p>
<p>In the north hills were also called <i>Law</i> and <i>Low</i>,
with such compounds as <i>Bradlaugh</i>, <i>Whitelaw</i>, and
<i>Harlow</i>. To these must be added <i>Barrow</i>, often
confused with the related <i>borough</i> (Chapter XIII). Both
belong to the Anglo-Sax. <i>beorgan</i>, to protect, cover. The
name Leatherbarrow means the hill, perhaps the burial mound, of
<i>Leather</i>, Anglo-Sax. Hlothere, cognate with Lothair and
Luther.</p>
<p>A hill-top was <i>Cope</i> or <i>Copp</i>. Chaucer uses it of

<i>Pick</i> of which we have the dim. in <i>Pickett</i> (cf. Fr.
Picot) and the softened <i>Piggot</i>. <i>Peak</i> may be in some
cases from the Derbyshire Peak, which has, however, no connection
with the common noun peak. A mere hillock or knoll has given the
names <i>Knapp</i>, <i>Knollys</i> or <i>Knowles</i>,
<i>Knock</i>, and <i>Knott</i>. But <i>Knapp</i> <i>may</i> also
be for Mid. Eng. <i>nape</i>, cognate with <i>knave</i> and with

<p><i><font face="Bookman Old Style">Redknap</font>, the name of
a Richmond boat-builder, is probably a nickname, like Redhead. A
Knapper may have lived on a "knap," or may have been one of the
Suffolk flint-knappers, who still prepare gun-flints for weapons
to be retailed to the heathen.</i></p>
<p><i>Knock</i> and <i>Knocker</i> are both Kentish names, and
there is a reef off Margate known as the Kentish Knock. We have
the plural <i>Knox</i> (cf. <i>Bax</i>, Settlements and
Enclosures, Chapter XIII). <i>Knott</i> is sometimes for Cnut, or
Canute, which generally becomes <i>Nutt</i>. Both have got mixed
with the nickname <i>Nott</i>.</p>
<p>A green knoll was also called <i>Toft</i> (Scand.), whence
<i>Langtoft</i>, and the name was used later for a homestead.
From <i>Cliff</i> we have <i>Clift</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> This
may also be from Mid. Eng, <i>clift</i>, a cleft.<i>]</i> with
excrescent -<i>t</i>, and the cognates <i>Cleeve</i> and
<i>Clive</i>. Compounds of <i>Cliff</i> are <i>Radcliffe</i>
(red), <i>Sutcliffe</i> (south), <i>Wyclif</i> (white). The c-
sometimes disappears in compounds, e.g. <i>Cunliffe</i>, earlier
Cunde-clive, and <i>Topliff;</i> but <i>Ayliffe</i> is for
AElfgifu or AEthelgifu and <i>Goodliffe</i> from Godleof (cf.
Ger. Gottlieb). The older form of <i>Stone</i> appears in
<i>Staines</i>, <i>Stanhope</i>, <i>Stanton</i>, etc.
<i>Wheatstone</i> is either for "white stone" or for the local
Whetstone (Middlesex). In <i>Balderstone</i>, <i>Johnston</i>,
<i>Edmondstone</i>, <i>Livingstone</i>, the suffix is
-<i>ton</i>, though the frequence of <i>Johnston</i> points to
corruption from <i>Johnson</i>, just as in Nottingham we have the
converse case of <i>Beeson</i> from the local <i>Beeston</i>. In
<i>Hailstone</i> the first element may be Mid. Eng, <i>half</i>,
holy. Another Mid. English name for a stone appears in
<i>Hone</i>, now used only of a whetstone.</p>
<p>A hollow or valley in the hillside was called in the north
<i>Clough</i>, also spelt <i>Clow</i>, <i>Cleugh</i> (Clim o' the
Cleugh), and <i>Clew</i>. The compound <i>Fairclough</i> is found
corrupted into <i>Faircloth</i>. Another obscure northern name
for a glen was <i>Hope</i>, whence <i>Allsop</i>,
<i>Blenkinsop</i>, the first element in each being perhaps the
name of the first settler, and <i>Burnup</i>, <i>Hartopp</i>,
(hart), <i>Harrap</i> (hare), <i>Heslop</i> (hazel).</p>
<p><i>Gill</i> (Scand.), a ravine, has given <i>Fothergill</i>,
<i>Pickersgill</i>, and <i>Gaskell</i>, from Gaisgill
(Westmorland). These, like most of our names connected with
mountain scenery, are naturally found almost exclusively in the
north. Other surnames which belong more or less to the hill
country are <i>Hole</i>, found also as <i>Holl</i>, <i>Hoole</i>,
and <i>Hoyle</i>, but perhaps meaning merely a depression in the
land, <i>Ridge</i>, and its northern form <i>Rigg</i>, with their
compounds <i>Doddridge</i>, <i>Langridge</i>, <i>Brownrigg</i>,
<i>Hazelrigg</i>, etc. <i>Ridge</i>, <i>Rigg</i>, also appear as
<i>Rudge</i>, <i>Rugg</i>. From Mid. Eng. <i>raike</i>, a path, a
sheep-track (Scand.), we get <i>Raikes</i> and perhaps

a famous faith-healer of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Very few surnames are taken, in any language, from the names
of rivers. This is quite natural, for just as the man who lived
on a hill became known as <i>Hill</i>, <i>Peake</i>, etc., and
not as Skiddaw or Wrekin, so the man who lived by the waterside
would be known as <i>Bywater</i>, <i>Rivers</i>, etc. No Londoner
talks of going on the Thames, and the country-dweller also
usually refers to his local stream as the river or the water, and
not by its geographical name. Another reason for the absence of
such surnames is probably to be found in the fact that our river
(and mountain) names are almost exclusively Celtic, and had no
connotation for the English population. We have many apparent
river names, but most of them are susceptible of another
explanation. <i>Dee</i> may be for <i>Day</i> as <i>Deakin</i> is
for <i>Dakin</i>, <i>i.e</i>. David, <i>Derwent</i> looks like
<i>Darwin</i> (Chapter VII) or the local <i>Darwen</i> with
excrescent -<i>t</i> (Chapter III), <i>Humber</i> is
<i>Humbert</i>, a French name corresponding to the Anglo-Sax,
Hunbeorht, <i>Medway</i> may be merely "mid-way," and
<i>Trent</i> is a place in Somerset. This view as to river
surnames is supported by the fact that we do not appear to have a
single mountain surname, the apparent exception, <i>Snowdon</i>,
being for <i>Snowden</i> (see <i>den</i>, <i>Dean</i>,
<i>Dene</i>, <i>Denne</i>). <i>[Footnote:</i> But see my
<i>Surnames</i>, Chapter XVI.<i>]</i></p>
<p>Among names for streams we have <i>Beck</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i>
The simple <i>Bec<a name="lastbookmark2" id=
"lastbookmark2"></a>k</i> is generally a German name of modern
introduction (see <i>pecch</i>).<i>]</i> cognate with Ger.
<i>Bach;</i> <i>Bourne</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> Distinct from
<i>bourne</i>, a boundary, Fr. <i>borne</i>.<i>]</i> or
<i>Burn</i>, cognate with Ger. <i>Brunnen;</i> <i>Brook</i>,
related to break; <i>Crick</i>, a creek; <i>Fleet</i>, a creek,
cognate with <i>Flood;</i> and <i>Syke</i>, a trench or rill. In
<i>Beckett</i> and <i>Brockett</i> the suffix is <i>head</i>
(Chapter XIII). <i>Troutbeck</i>, <i>Birkbeck</i> explain
themselves. In <i>Colbeck</i> we have cold, and <i>Holbrook</i>
contains hollow, but in some names -<i>brook</i> has been
substituted for -<i>borough</i>, -<i>burgh</i>. We find
<i>Brook</i> latinized as <i>Torrens</i>. <i>Aborn</i> <i>is</i>
for <i>atte</i> <i>bourne</i>, and there are probably many places
called <i>Blackburn</i> and <i>Otterburn</i>.</p>
<p><i>Firth</i>, an estuary, cognate with <i>fjord</i>, often
becomes <i>Frith</i>, but this surname usually comes from
<i>frith</i>, a park or game preserve (Chapter XIII).</p>
<p>Another word for a creek, <i>wick</i> or <i>wick</i> (Scand.),
cannot be distinguished from <i>wick</i>, a settlement.
<i>Pond</i>, a doublet of <i>Pound</i> (Chapter XIII), means a
piece of water enclosed by a dam, while natural sheets of water
are <i>Lake</i>, <i>or</i> <i>Lack</i>, not limited
originall<i>y</i> to a large expanse, <i>Mere</i>, whence
<i>Mears</i> and such compounds as <i>Cranmer</i> (crane),
<i>Bulmer</i> (bull), etc., and <i>Pool</i>, also spelt
<i>Pull</i> and <i>Pole</i>. We have compounds of the latter in
<i>Poulton</i> (Chapter I), <i>Claypole</i>, and
<i>Glasspool</i>.</p>
<p>In Kent a small pond is called <i>Sole</i>, whence
<i>Nethersole</i>. The bank of a river or lake was called
<i>Over</i>, cognate with Ger. <i>Ufer</i>, whence
<i>Overend</i>, <i>Overall</i> (see below), <i>Overbury</i>,
<i>Overland</i>. The surname <i>Shore</i>, for <i>atte</i>
<i>shore</i>, may refer to the sea-shore, but the word
<i>sewer</i> was once regularly so pronounced and the name was
applied to large drains in the fen country (cf. <i>Gott</i>,
Water, Chapter XIII). <i>Beach</i> <i>is</i> a word of late
appearance and doubtful origin, and as a surname is usually
identical with <i>Beech</i>.</p>
<p>Spits of land by the waterside were called <i>Hook</i> (cf.
Hook of Holland and Sandy Hook) and <i>Hoe</i> or <i>Hoo</i>, as
in Plymouth Hoe, or the Hundred of Hoo, between the Thames and
the Medway. From <i>Hook</i> comes <i>Hooker</i>, where it does
not mean a maker of hooks, while <i>Homan</i> and <i>Hooman</i>
sometimes belong to the second. Alluvial land by a stream was
called <i>halgh</i>, <i>haugh</i>, whence sometimes <i>Hawes</i>.
Its dative case gives <i>Hale</i> and <i>Heal</i>. These often
become -<i>hall</i>, -<i>all</i>, in place-names. Compounds are
<i>Greenhalgh</i>, <i>Greenall</i> and <i>Featherstonehaugh</i>,
perhaps our longest surname.</p>
<p><i>Ing</i>, a low-lying meadow, Mid. Eng. <i>eng</i>, survives
in <i>Greening</i>, <i>Fenning</i>, <i>Wilding</i>, and probably
sometimes in <i>England</i> (Chapter XI). But <i>Inge</i> and
<i>Ings</i>, the latter the name of one of the Cato Street
conspirators, also represent an Anglo-Saxon personal name. Cf.
<i>Ingall</i> and <i>Ingle</i>, from Ingwulf, or Ingold, whence
<i>Ingoldsby</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ey</i>, an island, <i>[Footnote:</i> Isle of Sheppey,
Mersea Island, etc, are pleonasms.]survives as the last element
of many names, and is not always to be distinguished from
<i>hey</i> <i>(hay</i>, Settlements, Chapter III) and <i>ley</i>.
Bill <i>Nye's</i> ancestor lived <i>atten</i> <i>ey</i> (Chapter
III). <i>Dowdney</i> or <i>Dudeney</i> has been explained from
the Anglo-Saxon name Duda, but it more probably represents the
very common French name <i>Dieudonn&eacute;</i>, corresponding to
Lat. Deodatus. In the north a river island was commonly called
<i>Holm</i> (Scand.), also pronounced <i>Home</i>, <i>Hulme</i>,
and <i>Hume</i>, in compounds easily confused with -<i>ham</i>,
e.g. Durham was once Dun-holmr, hill island. The very common
<i>Holmes</i> <i>is</i> probably in most cases a tree-name
(Chapter XII). In <i>Chisholm</i> the first element may mean
pebble; cf. Chesil Beach. The names <i>Bent</i>, whence
<i>Broadbent</i>, and <i>Crook</i> probably also belong sometimes
to the river, but may have arisen from a turn in a road or
valley. But <i>Bent</i> was also applied to a tract covered with
bents, or rushes, and <i>Crook</i> is generally a nickname
(Chapter XXII). Lastly, the crossing of the unbridged stream has
given us <i>Ford</i> or <i>Forth</i> whence <i>Stratford</i>,
<i>Strafford</i> (street), <i>Stanford</i>, <i>Stamford</i>,
<i>Staniforth</i> (stone), etc. The alternative name was
<i>Wade</i>, whence the compound <i>Grimwade</i>. The cognate
<i>wath</i> (Scand.) has been confused with <i>with</i> (Scand.),
a wood, whence the name <i>Wythe</i> and the compound
<i>Askwith</i> or <i>Asquith</i>. Both -<i>wath</i> and
<i>&ndash;with</i> have been often replaced by -<i>worth</i> and
-<i>wood</i>.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80763" id="Toc80763">TREE NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>In conclusion a few words must be said about tree names, so
common in their simple form and in topographical compounds. Here,
as in the case of most of the etymons already mentioned in this
chapter, the origin of the surname may be specific as well as
general, <i>i.e</i>. the name <i>Ash</i> may come from Ash in
Kent rather than from any particular tree, the etymology
remaining the same. Many of our surnames have preserved the older
forms of tree names, e.g. the <i>lime</i> was once the
<i>line</i>, hence <i>Lines</i>, <i>Lynes</i>, and earlier still
the <i>Lind</i>, as in the compounds <i>Lyndhurst</i>,
<i>Lindley</i>, etc. The older form of <i>Oak</i> appears in
<i>Acland</i>, <i>Acton</i>, and variants in <i>Ogden</i> and
<i>Braddock</i>, broad oak. We have ash in <i>Aston</i>,
<i>Ascham</i>. The <i>holly</i> was once the <i>hollin</i>,
whence <i>Hollins</i>, <i>Hollis</i>, <i>Hollings;</i> cf.
<i>Hollings</i>-<i>head</i>, <i>Holinshed</i>. But <i>hollin</i>
became colloquially <i>holm</i>, whence generally <i>Holmes</i>.
<i>Homewood</i> is for holm-wood. The holm oak, ilex, is so
called from its holly-like leaves. For <i>Birch</i> we also find
<i>Birk</i>, a northern form. <i>Beech</i> often appears in
compounds as <i>Buck</i>-<i>;</i> cf. buckwheat, so called
because the grains are of the shape of beech-mast. In
<i>Poppleton</i>, <i>Popplewell</i> we have the dialect
<i>popple</i>, a poplar. <i>Yeo</i> sometimes represents
<i>yew</i>, spelt <i>yowe</i> by Palsgrave. <i>[Footnote:</i> The
<i>yeo</i> of <i>yeoman</i>, which is conjectured to have meant
district, cognate with Ger. <i>Gau</i> in <i>Breisgau</i>,
<i>Rheingau</i>, <i>etc</i>., is not found by itself.<i>]</i></p>
<p>In <i>Sallows</i> we have a provincial name for the willow,
cognate with Fr, <i>saule</i> and Lat. <i>salix</i>.
<i>Rowntree</i> <i>is</i> the <i>rowan</i>, or mountain ash, and
<i>Bawtry</i> or <i>Bawtree</i> is a northern name for the elder.
The older forms of <i>Alder</i> and <i>Elder</i>, in both of
which the -<i>d</i>- is intrusive (Chapter III), appear in
<i>Allerton</i> and <i>Ellershaw</i>. <i>Maple</i> is sometimes
<i>Mapple</i> <i>and</i> <i>sycamore</i> is corrupted into
<i>Sicklemore</i>.</p>
<p>Tree-names are common in all languages. <i>Beerbohm</i>
<i>Tree</i> is pleonastic, from Ger. <i>Bierbaum</i>, for
<i>Birnbaum</i>, pear-tree. A few years ago a prominent Belgian
statesman bore the name <i>Vandenpereboom</i>, rather terrifying
till decomposed into "van den pereboom." Its Mid. English
equivalent appears in <i>Pirie</i>, originally a collection of
pear-trees, but used by Chaucer for the single tree</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">In almost every case where man
has interfered with nature the resulting local name is naturally
of Anglo-Saxon or, in some parts of England, of Scandinavian
origin. The Roman and French elements in our topographical names
are scanty in number, though the former are of frequent
occurrence. The chief Latin contributions <i>are</i>
-<i>Chester</i>, -<i>cester</i>, -<i>caster</i>, Lat.
<i>castrum</i>, a fort, or plural <i>castra</i>, a camp;
-<i>street</i>, Lat. <i>via</i> <i>strata</i>, a levelled way;
-<i>minster</i>, Lat. <i>monasterium;</i> and -<i>church</i> or
-<i>kirk</i>, Greco-Lat. <i>kuriakon</i>, belonging to the Lord.
<i>Eccles</i>, Greco-Lat. <i>ecclesia</i>, probably goes back to
Celtic Christianity. <i>Street</i> <i>was</i> the high-road,
hence <i>Greenstreet</i>. <i>Minster</i> <i>is</i> curiously
corrupted in <i>Buckmaster</i> for Buckminster and
<i>Kittermaster</i> for Kidderminster, while in its simple form
it appears as <i>Minister</i> (Chapter III).</font></p>
<p>We have a few French place-names, e.g. <i>Beamish</i> (Chapter
XIV), <i>Beaumont</i>, <i>Richmond</i>, Richemont, and
<i>Malpas</i> (Cheshire), the evil pass, with which we may
compare <i>Maltravers</i>. We have the apparent opposite in
<i>Bompas</i>, <i>Bumpus</i>, Fr. <i>bon</i> <i>pas</i>, but this
was a nickname. Of late there has been a tendency to introduce
the French <i>ville</i>, e.g. Bournville, near Birmingham. That
part of Margate which ought to be called Northdown is known as
Cliftonville, and the inhabitants of the opposite end of the
town, dissatisfied with such good names as Westbrook and Rancorn,
hanker after Westonville. But these philological atrocities are
fortunately too late to be perpetuated as surnames.</p>

<li>Highways and Byways,</li>

<p><b><a name="Toc80765" id="Toc80765">SETTLEMENTS AND
ENCLOSURES</a></b></p>
<p>The words which occur most commonly in the names of the modern
towns which have sprung from early homesteads are <i>borough</i>
or <i>bury</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> Originally the dative of
<i>borough</i>.] <i>by</i>, <i>ham</i>, <i>stoke</i>,
<i>stow</i>, <i>thorp</i>, <i>tun</i> or <i>ton</i>, <i>wick</i>,
and <i>worth</i>. These names are all of native origin, except
<i>by</i>, which indicates a Danish settlement, and <i>wick</i>,
which is supposed to be a very early loan from Lat. <i>vicus</i>,
cognate with Greek <i>oikos</i>, house. Nearly all of them are
common, in their simple form, both as specific place-names and as
surnames. <i>Borough</i>, cognate with Ger. <i>Burg</i>, castle,
and related to <i>Barrow</i> (Chapter XII), has many variants,
<i>Bury</i>, <i>Brough</i>, <i>Borrow</i>, <i>Berry</i>, whence
<i>Berryman</i>, and <i>Burgh</i>, the last of which has become
<i>Burke</i> in Ireland.</p>
<p>In <i>Atterbury</i> the preposition and article have both
remained, while in <i>Thornber</i> the suffix is almost
unrecognizable. <i>By</i>, related to <i>byre</i> and to the
preposition <i>by</i>, <i>is</i> especially common in Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire. It is sometimes spelt <i>bee</i>, e.g.
<i>Ashbee</i> for <i>Ashby</i>. The simple <i>Bye</i> is not
uncommon. <i>Ham</i> is cognate with <i>home</i>. In compounds it
is sometimes reduced to -<i>um</i>, e.g. <i>Barnum</i>,
<i>Holtum</i>, <i>Warnum</i>. But in some such names the
-<i>um</i> is the original form, representing an old dative
plural (Chapter III). <i>Allum</i> represents the usual Midland
pronunciation of <i>Hallam</i>. <i>Cullum</i>, generally for
Culham, may also represent the missionary Saint Colomb. In
<i>Newnham</i> the adjective is dative, as in Ger.
<i>Neuenheim</i>, at the new home. In <i>Bonham</i>,
<i>Frankham</i>, and <i>Pridham</i> the suffix -<i>ham</i> has
been substituted for the French <i>homme</i> of <i>bonhomme</i>,
<i>franc</i> <i>homme</i>, <i>prudhomme</i>, while
<i>Jerningham</i> is a perversion of the personal name Jernegan
or Gernegan, as <i>Garnham</i> is of Gernon, Old French for
<i>Beard</i> (Chapter XXI). <i>Stead</i> is cognate with Ger.
<i>Stadt</i>, place, town, and with <i>staith</i>, as in
<i>Bickersteth</i>(Chapter III). <i>Armstead</i> means the
dwelling of the hermit, <i>Bensted</i> the stead of Benna
(Chapter VII) or Bennet.</p>
<p><i>Stoke</i> is originally distinct from <i>Stock</i>, a
stump, with which it has become fused in the compounds
<i>Bostock</i>, <i>Brigstocke</i>. <i>Stow</i> appears in the
compound <i>Bristol</i> (Chapter XI) and in <i>Plaistow</i>,
play-ground (cf. <i>Playsted)</i>. <i>Thorp</i>, cognate with
Ger. <i>Dorf</i>, village, is especially common in the eastern
counties</p>

and probably <i>Thripp</i>, whence <i>Calthrop</i>,
<i>Winthrop</i>, <i>Westrupp</i>, etc.</font></p>
<p><i>Ton</i>, later <i>Town</i>, gave also the northern
<i>Toon</i>, still used in Scotland with something of its
original sense (Chapter XII). <i>Boston</i> is Botolf's town,
<i>Gunston</i> Gunolf's town. So also <i>Tarleton</i>
(Thurweald), <i>Monkton</i> (monk), <i>Preston</i> (priest).
<i>Barton</i> meant originally a barley-field, and is still used
in the west of England for a paddock. <i>Wick</i> appears also as
<i>Wych</i>, <i>Weech</i>. Its compounds cannot be separated from
those of <i>wick</i>, a creek (Chapter XII). <i>Bromage</i> is
for Bromwich, <i>Greenidge</i> for Greenwich, <i>Prestage</i> for
Prestwich; cf. the place-name Swanage (Dorset), earlier
Swanewic.</p>
<p><i>Worth</i> was perhaps originally applied to land by a river
or to a holm (Chapter XII); cf. Ger. Donauwert, Nonnenwert, etc.
<i>Harmsworth</i> <i>is</i> for Harmondsworth; cf.
<i>Ebbsworth</i> (Ebba), <i>Shuttleworth</i> (Sceotweald),
<i>Wadsworth</i> (Wada). Sometimes we find a lengthened form,
e.g. <i>Allworthy</i>, from <i>ald</i>, old (cf.
<i>Aldworth)</i>, <i>Langworthy</i>. <i>Rickworth</i>, further
corrupted to <i>Record</i>, is the Anglo-Saxon name Ricweard.
<i>Littleworth</i> may belong to this class, but may also be a
nickname. This would make it equivalent to the imitative
<i>Little</i>-<i>proud</i>, formerly Littleprow, from Old French
and Mid. Eng. <i>prou</i>, worth, value.</p>
<p>To this group may be added two more, which signify a mart,
viz. <i>Cheap</i> or <i>Chipp</i> (cf. Chepstow, Chipping Barnet)
and <i>Staple</i>, whence <i>Huxtable</i>, <i>Stapleton</i>, etc.
<i>Liberty</i>, that part of a city which, though outside the
walls, shares in the city privileges, and <i>Parish</i> also
occur as surnames, but the latter is usually for Paris.</p>
<p>Many other words connected with the delimitation of property
occur commonly in surnames. <i>Croft</i> or <i>Craft</i>, a small
field, is common in compounds such as <i>Beecroft</i> or
<i>Bearcroft</i> (barley), <i>Haycraft</i> (see <i>hay</i>,
below), <i>Oscroft(ox)</i>, <i>Rycroft</i>, <i>Meadowcroft</i>.
<i>[Footnote:</i> I remember reading in some story of a socially
ambitious lady who adopted this commonplace name instead of
<i>Gubbins</i>. The latter name came over, as Gobin, with the
Conqueror, and goes back to Old Ger. Godberaht, whence Old Fr.
Godibert.<i>]</i> <i>Fold</i> occurs usually as <i>Foulds</i>,
but we have compounds such as <i>Nettlefold</i>, <i>Penfold</i>
or <i>Pinfold</i> (Chapter XIII). <i>Sty</i>, not originally
limited to pigs, has given <i>Hardisty</i>, the sty of Heardwulf.
<i>Frith</i>, a park or game preserve, is probably more often the
origin of a surname than the other <i>frith</i> (Chapter XII). It
is cognate with Ger. Friedhof, cemetery. <i>Chase</i> is still
used of a park and <i>Game</i> once meant rabbit-warren.
<i>Warren</i> is Fr. <i>garenne</i>. <i>Garth</i>, the
Scandinavian doublet of <i>Yard</i>, and cognate with
<i>Garden</i>, has given the compounds <i>Garside</i>,
<i>Garfield</i>, <i>Hogarth</i> (from a place in Westmorland),
and <i>Applegarth</i>, of which <i>Applegate</i> is a corruption.
We have a compound of <i>yard</i> in <i>Wynyard</i>, Anglo-Sax.
<i>win</i>, vine. We have also the name <i>Close</i> and its
derivative <i>Clowser</i>. <i>Gate</i>, a barrier or opening,
Anglo-Sax. <i>geat</i>, is distinct from the Scandinavian
<i>gate</i>, a street (Chapter XIII), though of course confused
with it in surnames. From the northern form we have <i>Yates</i>,
<i>Yeats</i>, and <i>Yeatman</i>, and the compounds <i>Byatt</i>,
by gate, <i>Hyatt</i>, high gate. <i>Agate</i> is for <i>atte</i>
<i>gate</i>, and <i>Lidgate</i>, whence <i>Lidgett</i>, means a
swing gate, shutting like a lid. <i>Fladgate</i> is for
flood-gate. Here also belongs <i>Barr</i>. <i>Hatch</i>, the gate
at the entrance to a chase, survives in Colney Hatch. The
apparent dim. <i>Hatchett</i> is for <i>Hatchard</i> (Chapter
VIII); cf. <i>Everett</i> for Everard (Chapter II). <i>Hay</i>,
also <i>Haig</i>, <i>Haigh</i>, <i>Haw</i>, <i>Hey</i>, is
cognate with <i>Hedge</i>. Like most monosyllabic local surnames,
it is commonly found in the plural, <i>Hayes</i>, <i>Hawes</i>.
The bird nickname <i>Hedgecock</i> exists also as <i>Haycock</i>.
The curious-looking patronymics <i>Townson</i> and
<i>Orchardson</i> are of course corrupt. The former is for
<i>Tomlinson</i> and the latter perhaps from Achard (Chapter
VIII).</p>
<p>Several places and families in England are named <i>Hide</i>
or <i>Hyde</i>, which meant a certain measure of land. The
popular connection between this word and <i>hide</i>, a skin, as
in the story of the first Jutish settlement, is a fable. It is
connected with an Anglo-Saxon word meaning household, which
appears also in <i>Huish</i>, <i>Anglo</i>-<i>Sax.
hi</i>-<i>wisc</i>. <i>Dike</i>, or <i>Dyke</i>, and <i>Moat</i>,
also Mott, both have, or had, a double meaning. We still use
<i>dike</i>, which belongs to <i>dig</i> and <i>ditch</i>, both
of a trench and a mound, and the latter was the earlier meaning
of Fr. <i>motte</i>, now a clod, In Anglo-French we find
<i>moat</i> used of a mound fortress in a marsh. Now it is
applied to the surrounding water. From <i>dike</i> come the names
<i>Dicker</i>, <i>Dickman</i>, <i>Grimsdick</i>, etc. Sometimes
the name <i>Dykes</i> may imply residence near some historic
earthwork, such as Offa's Dyke, just as <i>Wall</i>, for which
<i>Waugh</i> was used in the north, may show connection with the
Roman wall. With these may be mentioned the French name
<i>Fosse</i>, whence the apparently pleonastic <i>Fosdyke</i> and
the name of Verdant Green's friend, Mr. Four-in-hand
<i>Fosbrooke</i>. <i>Delves</i> is from Mid. Eng. <i>dell</i>,
ditch. <i>Jury</i> is for Jewry, the quarter allotted to the
Jews, but <i>Jewsbury</i> is no doubt for Dewsbury; cf.
<i>Jewhurst</i> for Dewhurst.</p>
<p>Here may be mentioned a few local surnames which are hard to
classify. We have the apparently anatomical <i>Back</i>,
<i>Foot</i>, <i>Head</i>, and, in compounds, -<i>side</i>.
<i>Back</i> seems to have been used of the region behind <i>a</i>
building or dwelling, as it still is at Cambridge. Its plural has
given <i>Bax</i>. But it was also a personal name connected with
<i>Bacon</i> (Chapter XXIII).</p>
<p>We should expect <i>Foot</i> to mean the base of a hill, but
it always occurs in early rolls without a preposition. It may
represent in some cases an old personal name of obscure origin,
but it is also a nickname with compounds such as <i>Barfoot</i>,
<i>Lightfoot</i>. The simple <i>Head</i>, found as Mid. Eng.
<i>del</i> <i>heved</i>, is perhaps generally from a shop sign.
Fr. T&ecirc;te, one origin of <i>Tait</i>, <i>Tate</i>, and Ger.
Haupt, Kopf, also occur as surnames. As a local suffix
-<i>head</i> appears to mean top-end and is generally shortened
to -<i>ett</i>, e.g. <i>Birkett</i> (cf. Birkenhead),
<i>[Footnote:</i> No doubt sometimes, like <i>Burchett</i>,
<i>Burkett</i>, for the personal name Burchard, Anglo-Sax.
Burgheard<i>]</i> <i>Brockett</i> (brook), <i>Bromet</i>,
<i>Bromhead</i> (broom), <i>Hazlitt</i> (hazel). The same suffix
appears to be present in <i>Fossett</i>, from <i>fosse</i>, and
<i>Forcett</i> from <i>force</i>, a waterfall (Scand.).
<i>Broadhead</i> is a nickname, like Fr. <i>Grosset&ecirc;te</i>
and Ger. Breitkopf. The face-value of <i>Evershed</i> is boar's
head. <i>Morshead</i> may be the nickname of mine host of the
Saracen's Head or may mean the end of the moor. So the names
<i>Aked</i> (oak), <i>Blackett</i>, <i>Woodhead</i> may be
explained anatomically or geographically according to the choice
of the bearer. <i>Perrett</i>, usually a dim. of Peter, may
sometimes represent the rather effective old nickname
"pear-head."</p>
<p><i>Side</i> is local in the uncomfortable sounding
<i>Akenside</i> (oak), <i>Fearenside</i> (fern), but
<i>Heaviside</i> appears to be a nickname. <i>Handyside</i> may
mean "gracious manner," from Mid. Eng. <i>side</i>, cognate with
Ger. <i>Sitte</i>, custom. See <i>Hendy</i> (Chapter XXII). The
simple <i>end</i> survives as <i>Ind</i> or <i>Nind</i> (Chapter
III) and in <i>Overend</i> (Chapter XII), <i>Townsend</i>.
<i>Edge</i> appears also in the older form <i>Egg</i>, but the
frequency of place-names beginning with <i>Edge</i>, e.g.
Edgeley, Edgington, Edgworth, etc., suggests that it was also a
personal name.</p>
<p>Lynch, a boundary, is cognate with golf-links. The following
sounds modern, but refers to people sitting in a hollow among the
sand-ridges&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p>"And are ye in the wont of drawing up wi' a' the gangrel bodies that ye find

<p><i>Pitt</i> is found in the
compound <i>Bulpitt</i>, no doubt the place where the town bull was
kept. It is also the origin of the Kentish names <i>Pett</i> and <i>Pettman</i>
(Chapter XVII). <i>Arch</i> refers generally to a bridge. Lastly, there
are three words for a corner, viz. <i>Hearne, Herne, Hurne, Horn;
Wyke</i>, the same word as <i>Wick</i>, a creek (Chapter XII); and <i>Wray</i>
(Scand.). The franklin tell us that "yonge clerkes" desirous of
knowledge&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wray</i> has become
confused with <i>Ray</i> (Chapter III). Its compound <i>thack-wray</i>, the
corner where the thatch was stored, has given <i>Thackeray.</i></p>

<p>The word <i>road</i> was not used in its current sense during
the surname period, but meant the art of riding, and specifically
a raid or inroad. Therefore the name <i>Roades</i> is unconnected
with it and represents merely a variant of <i>Royds</i> (Chapter
XII). This name and its compounds belong essentially to the
north, the prevailing spelling, <i>Rhodes</i>, being artificial.
It has no connection with the island of Rhodes.</p>
<p>The meaning of <i>Street</i> has changed considerably since
the days when Icknield Street and Watling Street were great
national roads. It is now used exclusively of town thoroughfares,
and has become such a mere suffix that, while we speak of the
<i>Oxford</i> <i><u>R&oacute;ad</u></i>, we try to suppress the
second word in <i><u>Ox</u>'ford</i> <i>Street</i>. <i>To</i>
<i>street</i> belong our place-names and surnames in
<i>Strat</i>-, <i>Stret</i>-, etc., e.g. <i>Stratton</i>,
<i>Stretton</i>, <i>Stredwick</i>. <i>Way</i> has a number of
compounds with intrusive -a-, e.g. <i>Challaway</i>,
<i>Dallaway</i> (dale), <i>Greenaway</i>, <i>Hathaway</i>
(heath), <i>Westaway</i>. But <i>Hanway</i> <i>is</i> the name of
a country (Chapter XI), and <i>Otway</i>, <i>Ottoway</i>,
<i>is</i> Old Fr. Otouet, a dim. of Odo. <i>Shipway</i> <i>is</i>
for sheep-way. In the north of England the streets in a town are
often called <i>gates</i> (Scand.). It is impossible to
distinguish the compounds of this <i>gate</i> from those of the
native <i>gate</i>, a barrier (Chapter XIII), e.g. <i>Norgate</i>
may mean North Street or North Gate.</p>
<p><i>Alley</i> and <i>Court</i> both exist as surnames, but the
former is for <i>a'lee</i>, <i>i.e</i>. <i>Atlee</i> (Chapter
XII), and the latter is from <i>court</i> in the sense of
mansion, country house. The curious spelling <i>Caught</i> may be
seen over a shop in Chiswick. <i>Rowe</i> (Chapter I) sometimes
means row of houses, but in <i>Townroe</i> the second element is
identical with <i>Wray</i> (Chapter XIII). <i>Cosway</i>,
<i>Cossey</i>, <i>is</i> from causeway, Fr.
<i>chauss&eacute;e;</i> and <i>Twitchers</i>, <i>Twitchell</i>
represent dialect words used of a narrow passage and connected
with the Mid. English verb <i>twiselen</i>, to fork, or divide;
<i>Twiss</i> must be of similar origin, for we find Robert
<i>del</i> <i>twysse</i> in 1367. Cf. <i>Birtwistle</i> and
<i>Entwistle</i>. With the above may be classed the west-country
<i>Shute</i>, a narrow street; <i>Vennell</i>, a north-country
word for alley, Fr. <i>venelle</i>, dim. of Lat. <i>versa</i>,
vein; <i>Wynd</i>, a court, also a north-country word, probably
from the verb <i>wind</i>, to twist; and the cognate <i>Went</i>,
a passage&mdash;</p>

Lincolnshire for a water-drain on the coast; <i>Lade</i>,
<i>Leete</i>, connected with the verb to <i>lead;</i> and
sometimes <i>Shore</i> (Chapter XII), which was my grandfather's

<i>wehren</i>, to protect, we have not only <i>Weir</i>, but also
<i>Ware</i>, <i>Warr</i>, <i>Wear</i>, and the more pretentious
<i>Delawarr</i>. The latter name passed from an Earl Delawarr to
a region in North America, and thus to Fenimore Cooper's noble
red men. But this group of names must sometimes be referred to
the Domesday <i>wars</i>, an outlying potion of a manor.
<i>Lock</i> <i>is</i> more often a land name, to be classed with
<i>Hatch</i> (Chapter XIII), but was also used of a water-gate.
<i>Key</i> was once the usual spelling of <i>quay</i>. The
curious name <i>Keylock</i> <i>is</i> a perversion of
<i>Kellogg</i>, Mid. Eng. <i>Kill</i>-<i>hog</i>. <i>Port</i>
seldom belongs here, as the Mid. English is almost always
<i>de</i> <i>la</i> <i>Porte</i>, <i>i.e</i>. <i>Gates</i>. From
<i>well</i> we have a very large number of compounds, e.g.
<i>Cauldwell</i> (cold), <i>Halliwell</i>, the variants of which,
<i>Holliwell</i>, <i>Hollowell</i>, probably all represent Mid.
Eng. <i>hali</i>, holy. Here belongs also <i>Winch</i>, from the

<p>The greater number of the words to be dealt with under this
heading enter into the composition of specific place-names. A
considerable number of surnames are derived from the names of
religious buildings, usually from proximity rather than actual
habitation. Such names are naturally of Greco-Latin origin, and
were either introduced directly into Anglo-Saxon by the
missionaries, or were adopted later in a French form after the
Conquest. It has already been noted (Chapter I) that <i>Abbey</i>
<i>is</i> not always what it seems; but in some cases it is
local, from Fr, <i>abbaye</i>, of which the Proven&ccedil;al form
<i>Abadie</i> was introduced by the Huguenots. We find much
earlier <i>Abdy</i>, taken straight from the Greco-Lat.
<i>abbatia</i>. The famous name <i>Chantrey</i> <i>is</i> for
chantry, <i>Armitage</i> was once the regular pronunciation of
<i>Hermitage</i>, and <i>Chappell</i> a common spelling of
<i>Chapel</i>&mdash;</p>

this uncommon name, now generally perverted to <i>Galley</i>. In
a play now running (Feb. 1913) in London, there is a character
named <i>Sanctuary</i>, a name found also in Crockford and the
London Directory.</font></p>
<p>I have only once come across the contracted form <i>Sentry</i>
<i>[Footnote:</i> On the development in meaning of this word,
first occurring in the phrase "to take <i>sentrie</i>,"
<i>i.e</i>. refuge, see my <i>Romance</i> <i>of</i> <i>Words</i>,
ch. vii.<i>]</i> <i>(Daily</i> <i>Telegraph</i>, Dec. 26, 1912),
and then under circumstances which might make quotation
actionable. <i>Purvis</i> is Mid. Eng. p<i>arvis</i>, a porch,
Greco-Lat. <i>paradises</i>. It may be the same as <i>Provis</i>,
the name selected by Mr. Magwitch on his return from the
Antipodes <i>(Great</i> <i>Expectations</i>, ch. xl.), unless
this is for <i>Provost</i>. <i>Porch</i> and <i>Portch</i> both
occur as surnames, but <i>Porcher</i> is Fr. <i>porcher</i>, a
swineherd, and <i>Portal</i> <i>is</i> a Huguenot name.
<i>Churcher</i> and <i>Kirker</i>, <i>Churchman</i> and
<i>Kirkman</i>, are usually local; cf. <i>Bridges</i> and
<i>Bridgman</i>.</p>
<p>The names <i>Temple</i> and <i>Templeman</i> were acquired
from residence near one of the preceptories of the Knights
Templars, and <i>Spittlehouse</i> (Chapter III) is sometimes to
be accounted for in a similar way (Knights of the Hospital). We
even find the surname <i>Tabernacle</i>. <i>Musters</i> <i>is</i>
Old Fr. <i>moustiers</i> <i>(moutiers)</i>, common in French
place-names, from Lat. <i>monasterium</i>. The word <i>bow</i>,
still used for an arch in some old towns, has given the names
<i>Bow</i> and <i>Bowes</i>. <i>A</i> medieval statute, recently
revived to baffle the suffragettes, was originally directed
against robbers and "pillers," <i>i.e</i>. plunderers, but the
name <i>Piller</i> <i>is</i> also for pillar; cf. the French name
<i>Colonise</i>. With these may be mentioned <i>Buttress</i> and
<i>Carvell</i>, the latter from Old Fr. <i>carnet</i>
<i>(cr&eacute;neau)</i>, a battlement.</p>
<p>As general terms for larger dwellings we find <i>Hall</i>,
<i>House</i>, also written <i>Hose</i>, and <i>Seal</i>, the
last-named from the Teutonic original which has given Fr.
<i>Lasalle</i>, whence our surname <i>Sale</i>. To the same class
belong <i>Place</i>, <i>Plaice</i>, <i>as</i> in Cumnor
Place.</p>
<p>The possession of such surnames does not imply ancestral
possession of Haddon Hall, Stafford House, etc., but merely that
the founder of the family lived under the shadow of greatness. In
compounds -<i>house</i> is generally treated as in "workus," e.g.
<i>Bacchus</i> (Chapter VIII), <i>Bellows</i>, <i>Brewis</i>,
<i>Duffus</i> (dove), <i>Kirkus</i>, <i>Loftus</i>,
<i>Malthus</i>, <i>Windus</i> (wynd, Chapter XIII). In connection
with <i>Woodhouse</i> it must be remembered that this name was
given to the man who played the part of a "wild man of the woods"
in processions and festivities. William Power, skinner, called
"Wodehous," died in London in 1391. Of similar origin is
<i>Greenman</i>. The tavern sign of the Green Man is sometimes
explained as representing a forester in green, but it was
probably at first equivalent to the German sign "Zum wilden
Mann." <i>Cassell</i> <i>is</i> sometimes for <i>Castle</i>, but
is more often a local German name of recent introduction. The
northern <i>Peel</i>, a castle, as in the Isle of Man, was
originally applied to a stockade, Old Fr. <i>pel</i>
<i>(pieu)</i>, a stake, Lat. <i>Palos</i>. Hence also
<i>Peall</i>, <i>Peile</i>. <i>Keep</i> comes from the central
tower of the castle, where the baron and his family kept,
<i>i.e</i>. lived. A moated <i>Grange</i> <i>is</i> a poetic
figment, for the word comes from Fr, <i>grange</i>, a barn (to
Lat. <i>granum);</i> hence <i>Granger</i>.</p>
<p>With <i>Mill</i> and the older <i>Milne</i> (Chapter II) we
may compare <i>Mullins</i>, Fr. Desmoulins. <i>Barnes</i>
<i>is</i> sometimes, but not always, what it seems (Chapter XXI).
With it we may put <i>Leathes</i>, from an obsolete Scandinavian
word for barn (see quot. Chapter XIII), to which we owe also the
names <i>Leatham</i> and <i>Latham</i>. Mr. Oldbuck's "ecstatic
description" of the Roman camp with its praetorium was spoilt by

<i>Corrie</i>, a mountain glen, or to Curry in Somerset, and I

<p><b><a name="Toc80770" id="Toc80770">SHOP SIGNS</a></b></p>
<p>As is well known, medieval shops had signs instead of numbers,
and traces of this custom are still to be seen in country towns.
It is quite obvious that town surnames would readily spring into
existence from such signs. The famous name <i>Rothschild</i>,
always mispronounced in English, goes back to the "red shield"
over Nathan Rothschild's shop in the Jewry of Frankfurt; and
within the writer's memory two brothers named Grainge in the
little town of Uxbridge were familiarly known as Bible Grainge
and Gridiron Grainge. Many animal surnames are to be referred
partly to this source, e.g. <i>Bull</i>, <i>Hart</i>,
<i>Lamb</i>, <i>Lyon</i>, <i>Ram</i>, <i>Roebuck</i>,
<i>Stagg;</i> <i>Cock</i>, <i>Falcon</i>, <i>Peacock</i>,
<i>Raven</i>, <i>Swann</i>, etc., all still common as tavern
signs. The popinjay, or parrot, is still occasionally found as
<i>Pobgee</i>, <i>Popjoy</i>. These surnames all have, of course,
an alternative explanation (ch. xxiii.). Here also usually belong
<i>Angel</i> and <i>Virgin</i>.</p>
<p>A considerable number of such names probably consist of those
taken from figures used in heraldry or from objects which
indicated the craft practised, or the special commodity in which
the tradesman dealt. Such are <i>Arrow</i>, <i>Bell</i>,
<i>Buckle</i>, <i>Crosskeys</i>, <i>Crowne</i>, <i>Gauntlett</i>,
<i>Hatt</i>, <i>Horne</i>, <i>Image</i>, <i>Key</i>,
<i>Lilley</i>, <i>Meatyard</i>, measuring wand&mdash;</p>

<p>But here again we must walk delicately. The Germanic name
Hatto, borne by the wicked bishop who perished in the

accusative form <i>Hatton</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> In Old French a
certain number of names, mostly of Germanic origin, had an
accusative in -<i>on</i>, e.g. Guy, Guyon, Hugues, Hugon. From
Lat. <i>Pontius</i> came Poinz, Poinson, whence our
<i>Poyntz</i>, less pleasingly <i>Punch</i>, and <i>Punshon</i>.
In the Pipe Rolls these are also spelt Pin-, whence <i>Pinch</i>,

<i>Starling</i>) and <i>Bell</i> has several (chapter 1). I
should guess that <i>Porteous</i> was the sign used by some
medieval writer of mass-books and breviaries. Its oldest form is
the Anglo-Fr. <i>Porte</i>-<i>hors</i>, corresponding to medieval
Lat. <i>portiforium</i>, a breviary, lit. what one carries
outside, a portable prayer-book&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Not every Norman or Old French
name need be included in the group described by Emerson when
talking down to an uneducated audience. In fact, it is probable
that the majority of genuine French names belong to a later
period; for, although the baron who accompanied the Conqueror
would in many cases keep his old territorial designation, the
minor ruffian would, as a rule, drop the name of the obscure
hamlet from which he came and assume some surname more convenient
in his new surroundings. Local names of Old French origin are
usually taken from the provinces and larger towns which had a
meaning for English ears. I have given examples of such in
chapter xi. Of course it is easy to take a detailed map of
Northern France and say, without offering any proof, that
<i>"Avery</i> (Chapter VIII) is from Evreux, <i>Belcher</i>
(Chapter XXI) from Bellecourt, <i>Custance</i> (Chapter X) from
Coutances," and so on. But any serious student knows this to be
idiotic nonsense. The fact that, except in the small minority
composed of the senior branches of the noblest houses, the
surname was not hereditary till centuries after the Conquest,
justifies any bearer of a Norman name taken from a village or
smaller locality in repudiating all connection with the "filthy
thieves" and conjecturing descent from some decent artisan
belonging to one of the later immigrations.</font></p>
<p>That a considerable number of aristocratic families, and
others, bear an easily recognizable French town or village name
is of course well known, but it will usually be found that such
names are derived from places which are as plentiful in France as
our own Ashleys, Barton, Burton, Langleys, Newtons, Suttons,
etc., are in England. In some cases a local French name has
spread in an exceptional manner. Examples are <i>Baines</i>
(Gains, 2 <i>[Footnote:</i> The figures in brackets indicate the
number of times that the French local name occurs in the Postal
Directory. The above is the usual explanation of <i>Baines</i>.
found with <i>de</i> in the Hundred Rolls. But I think it was
sometimes a nickname, <i>bones</i>, applied to a thin man. I find
William <i>Banes</i> in Lancashire in 1252; cf. L<i>angbain</i>.]
), <i>Gurney</i> (Gournai, 6), <i>Vernon</i> (3). But usually in
such cases we find a large number of spots which may have given
rise to the surname, e.g. <i>Beaumont</i> (46, without counting
<i>Belmont)</i>, <i>Dampier</i> (Dampierre, <i>i.e</i>. St.
Peter's, 28), <i>Daubeney</i>, <i>Dabney</i> (Aubign&eacute;, 4,
Aubigny, 17), <i>Ferrers</i> (Ferri&eacute;res, 22),
<i>Nevill</i> (Neuville, 58), <i>Nugent</i> (Nogent, 17),
<i>Villiers</i> (58). This last name, representing Vulgar Lat.
<i>villarium</i>, is the origin of Ger. -<i>weiler</i>, so common
in German village names along the old Roman roads, e.g.
Badenweiler, Froschweiler, etc.</p>
<p>When we come to those surnames of this class which have
remained somewhat more exclusive, we generally find that the
place-name is also comparatively rare. Thus <i>Hawtrey</i> is
from Hauterive (7), <i>Pinpoint</i> from Pierrepont (5),
<i>Furneaux</i> from Fourneaux (5), <i>Vipont</i> and Vipan from
Vieux-Pont (3), and there are three places called
<i>Percy</i>.</p>
<p>The following have two possible birthplaces
<i>each&mdash;Bellew</i> or <i>Pellew</i> (Belleau),
<i>Cantelo</i> (Canteloup <i>[Footnote:</i> But the doublet
<i>Chanteloup</i> is common.<i>]</i> ), <i>Mauleverer</i>
(Maul&eacute;vrier), <i>Mompesson</i> (Mont Pin&ccedil;on or
Pinchon), <i>Montmorency</i>, <i>Mortimer</i> (Morte-mer). The
following are unique&mdash;Carteret, Doll <i>[Footnote:</i> This
may also be a metronymic, from Dorothy.<i>]</i> (Dol),
<i>Fiennes</i>, <i>Furnival</i> (Fournival), <i>Greville</i>,
<i>Harcourt</i>, <i>Melville</i> (Meleville), <i>Montresor</i>,
<i>Mowbray</i> (Monbrai), <i>Sackville</i> (Sacquenville),
<i>Venables</i>. These names are taken at random, but the same
line of investigation can be followed up by any reader who thinks
it worth while.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80772" id="Toc80772">CORRUPT FORMS</a></b></p>
<p>Apart from aristocratic questions, it is interesting to notice
the contamination which has occurred between English and French
surnames of local origin. The very common French suffix
-<i>ville</i> is regularly confounded with our -<i>field</i>.
Thus <i>Summerfield</i> <i>is</i> the same name as
<i>Somerville</i>, <i>Dangerfield</i> is for d'Angerville,
<i>Belfield</i> for Belleville, <i>Blomfield</i> for Blonville,
and <i>Stutfield</i> for Estouteville, while <i>Grenville</i>,
<i>Granville</i>have certainly become confused with our
<i>Grenfell</i>, green fell, and <i>Greenfield</i>. Camden notes
that <i>Turberville</i> became <i>Troublefield</i>, and I have
found the intermediate <i>Trubleville</i> in the twelfth century.
The case of Tess <i>Durbeyfield</i> will occur to every reader.
The suffix -<i>fort</i> has been confused with our -<i>ford</i>
and -<i>forth</i>, so that <i>Rochford</i> is in some cases for
Rochefort and <i>Beeforth</i> <i>for</i> Beaufort or Belfort.
With the first syllable of <i>Beeforth</i> we may compare
<i>Beevor</i> for Beauvoir, Belvoir, <i>Beecham</i> for
Beauchamp, and <i>Beamish</i> for Beau<i>mais</i>.</p>
<p>The name <i>Beamish</i> actually occurs as that of village in
Durham, the earlier form of which points Old French origin, from
<i>beau</i> <i>mes</i>, Lat. <i>bellum</i> <i>man</i>sum, a fair
manse, <i>i.e</i>. dwelling. Otherwise it would be tempting to
derive the surname <i>Beamish</i> from Ger, <i>b&ouml;hmisch</i>,
earlier <i>behmisch</i>, Bohemian.</p>
<p>A brief survey of French spot-names which have passed into
English will show that they were acquired in exactly the same way
as the corresponding English names. Norman ancestry, is, however,
not always to be assumed in this case. Until the end of the
fourteenth century a large proportion of our population was
bi-lingual, and names accidentally recorded in Anglo-French may
occasionally have stuck. Thus the name <i>Boyes</i> or
<i>Boyce</i> may spring from a man of pure English descent who
happened to be described as <i>del</i> <i>boil</i> instead of
<i>atte</i> <i>wood</i>, just as <i>Capron</i> (Chapter XXI)
means <i>Hood</i>. While English spot-names have as a rule shed
both the preposition and the article (Chapter XII), French
usually keeps one or both, though these were more often lost when
the name passed into England. Thus our <i>Roach</i> <i>is</i> not
a fish-name, but corresponds to Fr. <i>Laroche</i> or
<i>Delaroche;</i> and the blind pirate <i>Pew</i>, if not a
Welshman, ap Hugh, was of the race of <i>Dupuy</i>, from Old Fr.
<i>Puy</i>, a hill, Lat. <i>podium</i>, a height, gallery, etc.,
whence also our <i>Pew</i>, once a raised platform.</p>
<p>In some cases the prefix has passed into English; e.g.
<i>Diprose</i> <i>is</i> from <i>des</i> <i>pr&eacute;aux</i>, of
the meadows, a name assumed by Boileau among others. There are,
of course, plenty of places in France called <i>Les</i>
<i>Pr&eacute;aux</i>, but in the case of such a name we need not
go further than possession of, or residence by, a piece of
grass-land&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80773" id="Toc80773">TREE NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Trees have in all countries a strong influence on
topographical names, and hence on surnames. <i>Frean</i>, though
usually from the Scandinavian name Fraena, is sometimes for Fr.
<i>fr&ecirc;ne</i>, ash, Lat. <i>fraxinus</i>, while <i>Cain</i>
and <i>Kaines</i> <i>[Footnote:</i> There is one family of
<i>Keynes</i> derived specifically from Chahaignes
(Sarthe).<i>]</i> are Norm. <i>qu&ecirc;ne</i>
<i>(ch&ecirc;ne)</i>, oak. The modern French for beech is
<i>h&ecirc;tre</i>, Du. <i>heester</i>, but Lat. <i>fagus</i> has
given a great many dialect forms which have supplied us with the
surnames <i>Fay</i>, <i>Foy</i>, and the plural dim.
<i>Failes</i>. Here also I should put the name <i>Defoe</i>,
assumed by the writer whose father was satisfied with <i>Foe</i>.
With Quatrefages, four beeches, we may compare such English names
as <i>Fiveash</i>, <i>Twelvetrees</i>, and <i>Snooks</i>, for
"seven oaks."</p>
<p>In Latin the suffix -<i>etum</i> was used to designate a grove
or plantation. This suffix, or its plural -<i>eta</i>, <i>is</i>
very common in France, becoming successively -ei(e), -oi(e),
-ai(e). The name <i>Dobree</i> <i>is</i> a Guernsey spelling of
d'Aubray, Lat. <i>arboretum</i>, which was dissimilated (Chapter
III) into <i>arboretum</i>. <i>Darblay</i>, the name of Fanny
Burney's husband, is a variant. From <i>au(l)ne</i>, alder, we
have aunai, whence our <i>Dawnay</i>. So also fr&ecirc;<i>nai</i>
has given <i>Freeney</i>, <i>ch&ecirc;nai</i>, <i>Chaney</i>, and
the Norm. <i>qu&ecirc;nai</i> is one origin of <i>Kenney</i>,
while the older <i>chesnai</i> appears in <i>Chesney</i>.
<i>Houssaie</i>, from <i>hoax</i>, holly, gives <i>Hussey;</i>
<i>chastenai</i>, chestnut grove, exists in Nottingham as
<i>Chastener;</i> <i>coudrai</i>, hazel copse, gives
<i>Cowdrey</i> and <i>Cowdery;</i> <i>Verney</i> and
<i>Varney</i> are from <i>vernai</i>, grove of alders, of Celtic
origin, and <i>Viney</i> corresponds to the French name
<i>Vinoy</i>, Lat. <i>vinetum</i>.</p>
<p>We have also <i>Chinnery</i>, <i>Chenerey</i> from the
extended <i>ch&ecirc;nerai</i>, and <i>Pomeroy</i> from
<i>pommerai</i>. Here again the name offers no clue as to the
exact place of origin. There are in the French Postal Directory
eight places called &Eacute;pinay, from &eacute;<i>pine</i>,
thorn, but these do not exhaust the number of "spinnies" in
France. Also connected with tree-names are <i>Conyers</i>, Old
Fr, <i>coigniers</i>, quince-trees, and <i>Pirie</i>,
<i>Perry</i>, Anglo-Fr. <i>p&eacute;rie</i>, a collective from
<i>peire</i> <i>(poire)</i>.</p>
<p>Among Norman names for a homestead the favourite is
<i>mesnil</i>, from Vulgar Lat. <i>mansionile</i>, which enters
into a great number of local names. It has given our
<i>Meynell</i>, and is also the first element of
<i>Mainwaring</i>, <i>Mannering</i>, from
<i>mesnil</i>-<i>Warin</i>. The simple <i>mes</i>, a southern
form of which appears in Dumas, has given us <i>Mees</i> and
<i>Meese</i>, which are thus etymological doublets of the word
<i>manse</i>. With <i>Beamish</i> (Chapter XIV) we may compare
<i>Bellasis</i>, from <i>bel</i>-<i>assis</i>, fairly situated.
<i>Poyntz</i> <i>is</i> sometimes for <i>des</i> <i>ponts;</i>
cf. <i>Pierpoint</i> for <i>Pierrepont</i>.</p>
<p>Even Norman names which were undoubtedly borne by leaders
among the Conqueror's companions are now rarely found among the
noble, and many a descendant of these once mighty families
cobbles the shoes of more recent invaders. Even so the
descendants of the Spanish nobles who conquered California are
glad to peddle vegetables at the doors of San Francisco magnates
whose fathers dealt in old clothes in some German Judengasse.</p>

</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The occupative name would,
especially in villages, tend to become a very natural surname. It
is not therefore surprising to find so large a number of this
class among our commonest surnames, e.g. <i>Smith</i>,
<i>Taylor</i>, <i>Wright</i>, <i>Walker</i>, <i>Turner</i>,
<i>Clark</i>, <i>Cooper</i>, etc. And, as the same craft often
persisted in a family for generations, it was probably this type
of surname which first became hereditary. On the other hand, such
names as <i>Cook</i>, <i>Gardiner</i>, <i>Carter</i>, etc., have
no doubt in some cases prevailed over another surname lawfully
acquired (Chapter I). It is impossible to fix an approximate date
for the definite adoption of surnames of this class. It occurred
earlier in towns than in the country, and by the middle of the
fourteenth century we often find in the names of London citizens
a contradiction between the surname and the trade-name; e.g.
Walter <i>Ussher</i>, tanner, John <i>Botoner</i>, girdler, Roger
<i>Carpenter</i>, pepperer, Richard <i>le</i> <i>Hunte</i>,
chaundeler, occur <i>1336</i>-<i>52</i>.</font></p>
<p>The number of surnames belonging to this group is immense, for
every medieval trade and craft was highly specialized and its
privileges were jealously guarded. The general public, which now,
like Issachar, crouches between the trusts and the trades unions,
was in the middle ages similarly victimized by the guilds of
merchants and craftsmen.</p>
<p>Then, as now, it grumblingly recognized that, "Plus &ccedil;a
change, plus &ccedil;a reste la m&ecirc;me chose," and went on
enduring. <i>[Footnote:</i> If a student of philology were
allowed to touch on such high matters as legislation, I would
moralize on the word <i>kiddle</i>, meaning an illegal kind of
weir used for fish-poaching, whence perhaps the surname
<i>Kiddell</i>. From investigations made with a view to
discovering the origin of the word, I came to the conclusion that
all the legislative powers in England spent three centuries in
passing enactments against these devices, with the inevitable
consequence that they became ever more numerous.<i>]</i></p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80775" id="Toc80775">SOCIAL GRADES</a></b></p>
<p>By dealing with a few essential points at the outset we shall
clear the ground for considering the various groups of surnames
connected with trade, craft, profession or office. To begin with,
it is certain that such names as <i>Pope</i>, <i>Cayzer</i>,
<i>King</i>, <i>Earl</i>, <i>Bishop</i> are nicknames, very often
conferred on performers in religious plays or acquired in
connection with popular festivals and processions&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">"Names also have been
taken of civil honours, dignities and estate, as <i>King</i>,
<i>Duke</i>, <i>Prince</i>, <i>Lord</i>, <i>Baron</i>,
<i>Knight</i>, <i>Valvasor</i> or <i>Vavasor</i>, <i>Squire</i>,
<i>Castellon</i>, partly for that their ancestours were such,
served such, acted such parts; or were Kings of the Bean,
Christmas</font><font face=
"Bookman Old Style">-</font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">Lords, etc." (Camden).</font></p>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">We find corresponding names in
other languages, and some of the French names, usually preceded
by the definite article, have passed into English, e.g.
<i>Lempriere</i>, a Huguenot name, and <i>Lev&ecirc;que</i>,
whence our <i>Levick</i>, <i>Vick</i>, <i>Veck</i> (Chapter III).
<i>Baron</i> generally appears as <i>Barron</i>, and <i>Duke</i>,
used in Mid. English of any leader, is often degraded to
<i>Duck</i>, whence the dim. <i>Duckett</i>. But all three of
these names can also be referred to Marmaduke.</font></p>
<p>It would be tempting to put <i>Palsgrave</i> in this class.
Prince Rupert, the <i>Pfalzgraf</i>, <i>i.e</i>. Count Palatine,
was known as the Palsgrave in his day, but I have not found the
title recorded early enough.</p>
<p>With <i>Lord</i> we must put the northern <i>Laird</i>, and,
in my opinion, <i>Senior;</i> for, if we notice how much commoner
<i>Young</i> <i>is</i> than <i>Old</i>, and Fr. <i>Lejeune</i>
than <i>Levieux</i>, we must conclude that <i>junior</i>, a very
rare surname, ought to be of much more frequent occurrence than
<i>Senior</i>, <i>Synyer</i>, a fairly common name. There can be
little doubt that <i>Senior</i> <i>is</i> usually a latinization
of the medieval <i>le</i> <i>seigneur</i>, whence also
<i>Saynor</i>. <i>Knight</i> <i>is</i> not always knightly, for
Anglo-Sax. <i>cniht</i> means servant; cf. Ger. <i>Knecht</i>.
The word got on in the world, with the consequence that the name
is very popular, while its medieval compeers, knave, varlet,
villain, have, even when adorned with the adj. good, dropped out
of the surname list, <i>Bonvalet</i>, <i>Bonvarlet</i>,
<i>Bonvillain</i> are still common surnames in France. From
<i>Knight</i> we have the compound <i>Road</i>-<i>night</i>, a
mounted servitor. Thus <i>Knight</i> <i>is</i> more often a true
occupative name, and the same applies to <i>Dring</i> or
<i>Dreng</i>, a Scandinavian name of similar meaning.</p>
<p>Other names from the middle rungs of the social ladder are
also to be taken literally, e.g. <i>Franklin</i>, a freeholder,
Anglo-Fr. <i>frankelein</i>&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">

</div>
</div>
<p><i>Burgess, Freeman, Freeborn</i>.
The latter is sometimes for <i>Freebairn</i> and exists
already as the Anglo-Saxon personal name Freobeorn. <i>Denison</i>
(Chapter II) is occasionally an accommodated form of <i>denizen</i>,
Anglo-Fr. <i>deinzein</i>, a burgess enjoying the privileges belonging
to those who lived "<i>deinz</i> (in) <i>la cit&eacute;</i>." In 1483 a certain Edward

<p><i>Bond</i> is from
Anglo-Sax, <i>bonda</i>, which means simply agriculturist. The word is
of Icelandic origin and related to <i>Boor</i>, another word which has
deteriorated and is rare as a surname, though the cognate <i>Bauer</i>
is common enough in Germany. <i>Holder</i> is translated by <i>Tennant</i>. For
some other names applied to the humbler peasantry see Chapter
XIII.</p>
<p>To return to the social summit, we have <i>Kingson</i>, often
confused with the local <i>Kingston</i>, and its Anglo-French
equivalent <i>Fauntleroy</i>. <i>Faunt</i>, aphetic for Anglo-Fr.
<i>enfaunt</i>, <i>is</i> common in Mid. English. When the mother

Flourdieu. Lower, in his <i>Patronymics</i> <i>Britannica</i>
(1860), the first attempt at a dictionary of English surnames,
conjectures <i>Fauntleroy</i> to be from an ancient French
war-cry D&eacute;fendez le roi! for "in course of time, the
meaning of the name being forgotten, the <i>de</i> would be
dropped, and the remaining syllables would easily glide into

<p><b><a name="Toc80776" id="Toc80776">ECCLESIASTICAL
NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Names of ecclesiastics must usually be nicknames, because
medieval churchmen were not entitled to have descendants. This
appears clearly in such an entry as "<i>Bishop</i> the
crossbowman," or "Johannes <i>Monacus</i> et uxor ejus Emma,"
living in Kent in the twelfth century. But these names are so
numerous that I have put them with the Canterbury Pilgrims (ch.
xvii.). Three of them may be mentioned here in connection with a
small group of occupative surnames of puzzling form. We have
noticed (Chapter XII) that monosyllabic, and some other, surnames
of local origin frequently take an -<i>s</i>, partly by analogy
with names like <i>Wills</i>, <i>Watts</i>, <i>etc</i>. We rarely
find this -<i>s</i> in the case of occupative names, but
<i>Parsons</i>, <i>Vicars</i> or <i>Vickers</i>, and <i>Monks</i>
are common, and in fact the first two are scarcely found without
the -<i>s</i>. To these we may add <i>Reeves</i> (Chapter XVII),
<i>Grieves</i> (Chapter XIX), and the well-known Nottingham name
<i>Mellers</i> (Chapter XVII). The explanation seems to be that
these names are true genitives, and that John <i>Parsons</i> was
John the Parson's man, while John <i>Monks</i> was employed by
the monastery. This is confirmed by such entries as "Walter
<i>atte</i> <i>Parsons</i>,<i>"</i> <i>"</i>John <i>del</i>
<i>Parsons</i>,<i>"</i> <i>"</i>Allen <i>atte</i>
<i>Prestes</i>," "William <i>del</i> <i>Freres</i>,<i>"</i>
<i>"</i>Thomas <i>de</i> <i>la</i> <i>Vicars</i>,<i>"</i> all
from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Another exceptional group is that of names formed by adding
-<i>son</i> to the occupative names, the commonest being perhaps
<i>Clarkson</i>, <i>Cookson</i>, <i>Smithson</i>, and
<i>Wrightson</i>. To this class belongs <i>Grayson</i>, which

<i>Bowker</i>, and sometimes the later <i>Bosher</i>,

also mean what it appears to mean, as Mid. Eng. <i>bokere</i>

<p><i>Butcher</i>, originally a dealer in goat's flesh, Fr.

dozen surnames derived from names for this trade, e.g.
<i>Fleischer</i>, <i>Fleischmann</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i>
Hellenized as Sarkander. This was a favourite trick of German
scholars at the Renaissance period. Well-known examples are
Melancthon (Schwarzerd), Neander (Neumann).] <i>Metzger</i>,
<i>Schlechter;</i> but our <i>flesher</i> has been absorbed by
<i>Fletcher</i>, a maker of arrows, Fr. <i>fl&ecirc;che</i>.
Fletcher Gate at Nottingham was formerly Flesher Gate. The undue
extension of <i>Taylor</i> has already been mentioned (Chapter
IV). Another example is <i>Barker</i>, which has swallowed up the
Anglo-Fr. <i>berquier</i>, a shepherd, Fr. <i>berger</i>, with
the result that the <i>Barkers</i> outnumber the <i>Tanners</i>

TRADESMEN</a></b></p>
<p>With <i>Barker</i> it seems natural to mention <i>Mewer</i>,
of which I find one representative in the London Directory. The
medieval <i>le</i> <i>muur</i> had charge of the mews in which
the hawks were kept while moulting (Fr. <i>muer</i>, Lat.
<i>mutare)</i>. Hence the phrase "mewed up." The word seems to
have been used for any kind of coop. Chaucer tells us of the
Franklin&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">"Ful
many a fat partrich hadde he in muw" (A, 349).</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">I suspect that some of the
<i>Muirs</i> (Chapter XII) spring from this important office.
Similarly <i>Clayer</i> has been absorbed by the local
<i>Clare</i>, <i>Kayer</i>, the man who made keys, by
<i>Care</i>, and <i>Blower</i>, whether of horn or bellows, has
paid tribute to the local <i>Bloor</i>, <i>Blore</i>.</font></p>
<p><i>Sewer</i>, an attendant at table, aphetic for Old Fr.
<i>asseour</i>, a setter, is now a very rare name. As we know
that <i>sewer</i>, a drain, became <i>shore</i>, it is probable
that the surname <i>Shore</i> sometimes represents this official
or servile title. And this same name <i>Shore</i>, though not
particularly common, and susceptible of a simple local origin,
labours under grave suspicion of having also enriched itself at
the expense of the medieval <i>le</i> <i>suur</i>, the shoemaker,
Lat. <i>sutor</i>-<i>em</i>, whence Fr. <i>Lesueur</i>. This
would inevitably become <i>Sewer</i> and then <i>Shore</i>, as
above. Perhaps, in the final reckoning, <i>Shaw</i> <i>is</i> not
altogether guiltless, for I know of one family in which this has
replaced earlier <i>Shore</i>.</p>
<p>The medieval <i>le</i> <i>suur</i> brings us to another
problem, viz. the poor show made by the craftsmen who clothed the
upper and lower extremities of our ancestors. The name
<i>Hatter</i>, once frequent enough, is almost extinct, and
<i>Capper</i> is not very common. The name <i>Shoemaker</i> has
met with the same fate, though the trade is represented by the
Lat. <i>Sutor</i>, whence Scot. <i>Souter</i>. Here belong also
<i>Cordner</i>, <i>Codner</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> Confused, of
course, with the local <i>Codnor</i> (Derbyshire)<i>]</i> Old Fr.
<i>cordouanier</i> <i>(cordonnier)</i>, a <i>cordwainer</i>, a
worker in Cordovan leather, and <i>Corser</i>, <i>Cosser</i>,
earlier <i>corviser</i>, corresponding to the French name
<i>Courvoisier</i>, also derived from Cordova. Chaucer, in
describing the equipment of Sir Thopas, mentions</p>

SPELLING OF TRADE-NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>The spelling of occupative surnames often differs from that
now associated with the trade itself. In <i>Naylor</i>,
<i>Taylor</i>, and <i>Tyler</i> we have the archaic preference
for <i>y</i>. <i>[Footnote:</i> It may be noted here that John
Tiler of Dartford, who killed a tax-gatherer for insulting his
daughter, was not Wat Tiler, who was killed at Smithfield for
insulting the King. The confusion between the two has led to much
sympathy being wasted on a ruffian.<i>]</i> Our ancestors thought
<i>sope</i> as good a spelling as <i>soap</i>, hence the name
<i>Soper</i>. A <i>Plummer</i>, <i>i.e</i>. a man who worked in
lead, Lat. <i>plumbum</i>, is now written, by etymological
reaction, plumber, though the restored letter is not sounded. A
man who dealt in <i>'arbs</i> originated the name <i>Arber</i>,
which we should now replace by herbalist. We have a restored
spelling in <i>clerk</i>, though educated people pronounce the
word as it was once written</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">In many cases we are unable to
say exactly what is the ocpupation indicated. We may assume that
a <i>Setter</i> and a <i>Tipper</i> did setting and tipping, and
both are said to have been concerned in the arrow industry. If
this is true, I should say that <i>Setter</i> might represent the
Old Fr, <i>saieteur</i>, arrow-maker, from <i>saiete</i>, an
arrow, Lat. <i>sagitta</i>. But in a medieval vocabulary we find
"<i>setter</i> of mes, <i>dapifer</i>,<i>"</i> which would make
it the same as <i>Sewe</i>r (Chapter XV). Similarly, when we
consider the number of objects that can be tipped, we shall be
shy of defining the activity of the Tipper too closely.
<i>Trinder</i>, earlier <i>trenden</i>, is from Mid. Eng.
<i>trender</i>, to roll (cf. <i>Roller)</i>. In the west country
<i>trinder</i> now means specifically a
wool-winder&mdash;</font></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">There are also some names of
this class to which we can with certainty attribute two or more
origins. <i>Boulter</i> means a maker of bolts for crossbows,
<i>[Footnote:</i> How many people who use the expression

are generally connected with leather, but Henry VII. bestowed
&pound;3 on the <i>Curren</i> that brought tidings of Perkin
War-beck. <i>Garner</i> has five possible origins: (<i>i</i>) a

personal name <i>Garner</i>, Ger. <i>Werner</i>, <i>(iii)</i> Old
Fr. <i>grenier</i>, grain-keeper, (<i>iv</i>) Old Fr,

<p>Such names as <i>Ginger</i>, <i>Pepper</i>, may however belong
to the class of nicknames conferred on dealers in certain
commodities; cf. <i>Pescod</i>, <i>Peskett</i>, from pease-cod.
Of this we have several examples which can be confirmed by
foreign parallels, e.g. <i>Garlick</i>, found in German as
Knoblauch, <i>[Footnote:</i> The cognate Eng.
<i>Clove</i>-<i>leek</i> occurs as a surname in the Ramsey
Chartulary.<i>]</i> <i>Straw</i>, represented in German by the
cognate name Stroh, and <i>Pease</i>, which is certified by Fr.
Despois. We find <i>Witepease</i> in the twelfth century.</p>
<p>Especially common are those names which deal with the two
staple foods of the country, bread and beer. In German we find
several compounds of <i>Brot</i>, bread, and one of the greatest
of chess-players bore the amazing name <i>Zuckertort</i>,
sugar-tart. In French we have such names as Painchaud,

<i>Simnel</i> <i>is</i> explained in the same way, and Lambert

<i>Wastall</i> <i>is</i> found in the Hundred Rolls as

</div>
<p><i>Goodbeer</i> is explained
by Bardsley as a perversion of <i>Godber</i> (Chapter VII), which may be
true, but the name is also to be taken literally. We have Ger.
<i>Gutbier</i>, and the existence of <i>Sourale</i> in the Hundred Rolls and
<i>Sowerbutts</i> at the present day justifies us in accepting both
<i>Goodbeer</i> and <i>Goodale</i> at their face-value. But <i>Rice</i> is an
imitative form of Welsh <i>Rhys</i>, <i>Reece</i>, and <i>Salt</i>, when not derived
from Salt in Stafford, is from Old Fr. <i>sault</i>, a wood, Lat.
<i>saltus</i>. [Footnote: This is common in place-names, and I should
suggest, as a guess, that <i>Sacheverell</i> is from the village of
Sault-Chevreuil-du-Tronchet (Manche).] It is doubtful whether the
name <i>Cheese</i> is to be included here. Jan Kees, for John Cornelius,
said to have been a nickname for a Hollander, may easily have
reached the Eastern counties. Bardsley's earliest instance for
the name is John <i>Chese</i>, who was living in Norfolk in 1273. But
still I find <i>Furmage</i> as a medieval surname.</p>
<p>We also have the dealer in meat represented by the classical
example of <i>Hogsflesh</i>, with which we may compare
<i>Mutton</i> and <i>Veal</i>, two names which may be seen fairly
near each other in Hammersmith Road (but for these see also
Chapter XXIII), and I have known a German named Kalbfleisch.
Names of this kind would sometimes come into existence through
the practice of crying wares; though if Mr. <i>Rottenherring</i>,
who was a freeman of York in <i>1332</i>, obtained his in this
way, he must have deliberately ignored an ancient piece of
wisdom.</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The fairly common name
<i>Rutter</i> is a good example of the difficulty of explaining a
surname derived from a trade or calling no longer practised. Even
so careful an authority as Bardsley has gone hopelessly astray
over this name. He says, "German <i>ritter</i>, a rider,
<i>i.e</i>. a trooper," and quotes from Halliwell,
"<i>rutter</i>, a rider, a trooper, from the German; a name given
to mercenary soldiers engaged from Brabant, etc." Now this
statement is altogether opposed to chronology. The name occurs as
<i>le</i> <i>roter</i>, <i>rotour</i>, <i>ruter</i> in the
Hundred Rolls of 1273, <i>i.e</i>. more than two centuries before
any German name for trooper could possibly have become familiar
in England. Any stray Mid. High Ger. <i>Riter</i> would have been
assimilated to the cognate Eng. <i>Rider</i>. It is possible that
some German <i>Reuters</i> have become English <i>Rutters</i> in
comparatively modern times, but the German surname <i>Reuter</i>
has nothing to do with a trooper. It represents Mid. High Ger.
<i>riutaere</i>, a clearer of land, from the verb <i>riuten</i>
<i>(reuten)</i>, corresponding to Low Ger. <i>roden</i>, and
related to our <i>royd</i>, a clearing (Chapter XII). This word
is apparently not connected with our <i>root</i>, though it means
to root out, but ultimately belongs to a root <i>ru</i> which
appears in Lat. <i>rutrum</i>, a spade, <i>rutabulum</i>, a rake,
etc.</font></p>
<p>There is another Ger. <i>Reuter</i>, a trooper, which has
given the sixteenth-century Eng. <i>rutter</i>, but not as a
surname. The word appears in German about 1500, <i>i.e</i>.
rather late for the surname period, and comes from Du.
<i>ruiter</i>, a mercenary trooper. The German for trooper is
<i>Reiter</i>, really the same word as <i>Ritter</i>, a knight,
the two forms having been differentiated in meaning; cf. Fr.
<i>cavalier</i>, a trooper, and <i>chevalier</i>, a knight. In
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Ger. <i>Reiter</i> was
confused with, and supplanted by, this borrowed word
<i>Reuter</i>, which was taken to mean rider, and we find the
cavalry called <i>Reuterei</i> well into the eighteenth century.
As a matter of fact the two words are quite unrelated, though the
origin of Du. <i>ruiter</i> is disputed.</p>
<p>The New English Dictionary gives, from the year 1506,
<i>rutter</i> (var. <i>ruter</i>, <i>ruiter)</i>, a cavalry
soldier, especially German, from Du. <i>ruiter</i>, whence Ger.
<i>Reuter</i>, as above. It connects the Dutch word with medieval
Lat. <i>rutarius</i>, <i>i.e</i>. <i>ruptarius</i>, which is also
Kluge's view. <i>[Footnote:</i> Deutsches Etymologisches
Wrterbuch.<i>]</i> But Franck <i>[Footnote:</i> Etymologisch
Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal.<i>]</i> sees phonetic
difficulties and prefers to regard <i>ruiter</i> as belonging
rather to <i>ruiten</i>, to uproot. The application of the name
up-rooter to a lawless mercenary is not unnatural.</p>
<p>But whatever be the ultimate origin of this Dutch and German
military word, it is sufficiently obvious that it cannot have
given an English surname which is already common in the
thirteenth century. There is a much earlier claimant in the
field.</p>
<p>The New English Dictionary has <i>roter</i> (1297), var.
<i>rotour</i>, <i>rotor</i>, and <i>router</i> (1379), a lawless
person, robber, ruffian, from Old Fr. <i>rotier</i>
<i>(routier)</i>, and also the form <i>rutar</i>, used by
Philemon Holland, who, in his translation of Camden's
<i>Britannia</i> (1610), says "That age called foraine and
willing souldiours <i>rutars</i>." The reference is to King
John's mercenaries, <i>c</i>. 1215. Fr, <i>routier</i>, a
mercenary, is usually derived from <i>route</i>, a band, Lat.
<i>rupta</i>, a piece broken off, a <i>detachment</i>. References
to the <i>grander</i> <i>routes</i>, the great mercenary bands
which overran France in the fourteenth century, are common in
French history. But the word was popularly, and naturally,
connected with <i>route</i>, Lat. <i>(via)</i> <i>rupta</i>, a
highway, so that Godefroy <i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Dictionnaire</i>
<i>de</i> <i>rancien</i> <i>Fran&ccedil;ais</i>.] separates
<i>routier</i>, a vagabond, from <i>routier</i>, a bandit
soldier. Cotgrave has&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">"<i>Routier</i>, an
old traveller, one that by much trotting up and down is grown
acquainted with most waies; and hence, an old beaten souldier;
one whom a long practise hath made experienced in, or absolute
master of, his profession; and (in evill part) an old crafty fox,
notable beguiler, ordinary deceiver, subtill knave; also, a
purse</font><font face="Bookman Old Style">-</font><font face=
"Bookman Old Style" size="3">taker, or a robber by the high way
side."</font></p>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">It is impossible to determine
the relative shares of <i>route</i>, a band, and <i>route</i>, a
highway, in this definition, but there has probably been natural
confusion between two words, separate in meaning, though
etymologically identical.</font></p>
<p>Now our thirteenth-century <i>rotors</i> and <i>rulers</i> may
represent Old Fr. <i>routier</i>, and have been names applied to
a mercenary soldier or a vagabond. But this cannot be considered
certain. If we consult du Cange, <i>[Footnote:</i>
<i>Glossarium</i> <i>ad</i> <i>Scriptures</i> <i>medics</i>
<i>et</i> <i>inflows</i> <i>Latinitatis</i>.] we find, s.v.
<i>rumpere</i>, <i>"ruptarii</i>, pro <i>ruptuarii</i>, quidam
praedones sub xi saeculum, ex rusticis. . . collecti ac
conflati," which suggests connection with "<i>ruptuarius</i>,
colonus qui agrum seu terram rumpit, proscindit, colic,"
<i>i.e</i>. that the <i>ruptarii</i>, also called <i>rutarii</i>,
<i>rutharii</i>, <i>rotharii</i>, <i>rotarii</i>, etc., were so
named because they were revolting peasants, <i>i.e</i>. men
connected with the <i>roture</i>, or breaking of the soil, from
which we get <i>roturier</i>, a plebeian. That would still
connect our <i>Rutters</i> with Lat. <i>rumpere</i>, but by a
third road.</p>
<p>Finally, Old French has one more word which seems to me quite
as good a candidate as any of the others, viz. <i>roteur</i>, a
player on the <i>rote</i>, <i>i.e</i>. the fiddle used by the
medieval minstrels, Chaucer says of his Frere&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p>"Wel koude he synge and playen on a <i>rote</i>.<i>"</i> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 18em">
<p>(A, 236.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The word is possibly of Celtic
origin (Welsh <i>crwth)</i> and a doublet of the archaic
<i>crowd</i>, or <i>crowth</i>, a fiddle. Both <i>rote</i> and
<i>crowth</i> are used by Spenser. <i>Crowd</i> is perhaps not
yet obsolete in dialect, and the fiddler in Hudibras is called
<i>Crowdero</i>. Thus <i>Rutter</i> may be a doublet of
<i>Crowther</i>. There may be other possible etymologies for
<i>Rutter</i>, but those discussed will suffice to show that the
origin of occupative names is not always easily
guessed.</font></p>
<p>Since the above was written I have found strong evidence for
the "fiddler" derivation of the name. In 1266 it was decided by a
Lancashire jury that Richard <i>le</i> <i>Harper</i> killed
William <i>le</i> <i>Roter</i>, or <i>Ruter</i>, in self-defence.
I think there can be little doubt that some, if not all, of our
<i>Rutters</i> owe their names to the profession represented by
this enraged musician. William <i>le</i> <i>Citolur</i> and
William <i>le</i> <i>Piper</i> also appear from the same record
(Patent Rolls) to have indulged in homicide in the course of the
year.</p>

<p>The wool trade occupied a very large number of workers and has
given a good many surnames. The <i>Shearer</i> was distinct from
the <i>Shearman</i> or <i>Sherman</i>, the former operating on
the sheep and the latter on the nap of the cloth. For
<i>Comber</i> we also have the older <i>Kempster</i>, and
probably <i>Kimber</i>, from the Mid. Eng. <i>kemben</i>, to
comb, which survives in "unkempt". The <i>Walker</i>,
<i>Fuller</i>, and <i>Tucker</i>, all did very much the same work
of "waulking," or trampling, the cloth. All three words are used
in Wyclif's Bible in variant renderings of Mark ix. 3.
<i>Fuller</i> is from Fr. <i>fouler</i>, to trample, and
<i>Tucker</i> is of uncertain origin. <i>Fuller</i> is found in
the south and south-east, <i>Tucker</i> in the west, and
<i>Walker</i> in the north. A <i>Dyer</i> was also called
<i>Dyster</i>, and the same trade is the origin of the
Latin-looking <i>Dexter</i> (Chapter II). From Mid. Eng.
<i>litster</i>, a dyer, a word of Scandinavian origin, comes
<i>Lister</i>, as in Lister Gate, Nottingham. With these goes the
<i>Wadman</i>, who dealt in, or grew, the dye-plant called woad;
cf. <i>Flaxman</i>. A beater of flax was called
<i>Swingler&mdash;</i></p>

<p>We have already noticed the predominance of <i>Taylor</i>.
This is the more remarkable when we consider that the name has as
rivals the native <i>Seamer</i> and <i>Shapster</i> and the
imported <i>Parmenter</i>, Old Fr. <i>parmentier</i>, a maker of
<i>parements</i>, now used chiefly of facings on clothes. But
another, and more usual, origin of <i>Parmenter</i>,
<i>Parminter</i>, <i>Parmiter</i>, is <i>parchmenter</i>, a very
important medieval trade. The word would correspond to a Lat.
<i>pergamentarius</i>, which has given also the German surname
<i>Berminter</i>. Several old German cities had a Permentergasse,
<i>i.e</i>. parchment-makers' street. A <i>Pilcher</i> made

clothes is <i>Chaucer</i>, Old Fr. <i>chaussier</i>, a hosier

reminds us of the native word. The oldest meaning of hose seems
to have been gaiters. It ascended in Tudor times to the dignity
of breeches (cf. trunk-hose), the meaning it has in modern
German. Now it has become a tradesman's euphemism for the
improper word stocking, a fact which led a friend of the
writer's, imperfectly acquainted with German, to ask a gifted
lady of that nationality if she were a <i>Blauhose</i>. A

<p><b><a name="Toc80789" id="Toc80789">METAL WORKERS</a></b></p>
<p>Some metal-workers have already been mentioned in connection
with <i>Smith</i> (Chapter IV), and elsewhere. The French
F&egrave;vre, from Lat. <i>faber</i>, is found as <i>Feaver</i>.
<i>Fearon</i> comes from Old Fr, <i>feron</i>, <i>ferron</i>,
smith. <i>Face</i> <i>le</i> <i>ferrun</i>, <i>i.e</i>. Boniface
(Chapter III) the smith, lived in Northampton in the twelfth
century. This is an example of the French use of -<i>on</i> as an
agential suffix. Another example is Old Fr. <i>charton</i>, or
<i>charreton</i>, a waggoner, from the Norman form of which we
have <i>Carton</i>. In <i>Scriven</i>, from Old Fr.
<i>escrivain</i> <i>(&eacute;crivain)</i>, we have an isolated
agential suffix. The English form is usually lengthened to
<i>Scrivener</i>. In <i>Ferrier</i>, for farrier, the traditional
spelling has prevailed over the pronunciation, but we have the
latter in <i>Farrar</i>. <i>Ferrier</i> sometimes means ferryman,
and <i>Farrar</i> has absorbed the common Mid. English nickname
<i>Fayrhayr</i>. <i>Aguilar</i> means needle-maker, Fr.
<i>aiguille</i>, but <i>Pinner</i> is more often official
(Chapter XIX). <i>Culler</i>, Fr. <i>coutelier</i>, Old Fr.
<i>coutel</i>, knife, and <i>Spooner</i> go together, but the
fork is a modern fad. <i>Poynter</i> is another good example of
the specialization of medieval crafts: the points were the metal
tags by which the doublet and hose were connected. Hence, the
play on words when Falstaff is recounting his adventure with the
men in buckram&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">

etymological origin is unknown. The Pardoner<font face=

<p align="center"><font face="Bookman Old Style">"Hadde a croys

<p>For the change from -<i>n</i> to -<i>m</i> we may compare
<i>Lorimer</i> for <i>Loriner</i>, a bridle-maker, belonging
ultimately to Lat. <i>lorum</i>, "the reyne of a brydle"
(Cooper). But <i>Latimer</i> comes also from Latiner, a man
skilled in Latin, hence an interpreter, Sir John Mandeville tells
us that, on the way to Sinai-&mdash;</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The immortal <i>Bowdler</i> is
usually said to take his name from the art of puddling, or
buddling, iron ore. But, as this process is comparatively modern,
it is more likely that the name comes from the same verb in its
older meaning of making impervious to water by means of clay.
<i>Monier</i> and <i>Minter</i> are both connected with coining,
the former through French and the latter from Anglo-Saxon, both
going back to Lat. <i>moneta</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> On the
curiously accidental history of this word see the <i>Romance</i>
<i>of</i> <i>Words</i>, ch. <i>x</i>.<i>]</i> mint.
<i>Conner</i>, <i>i.e</i>. coiner, is now generally swallowed up
by the Irish <i>Connor</i>.</font></p>
<p><i>Leadbitter</i> is for <i>Leadbeater</i>. The name
<i>Hamper</i> is a contraction of <i>hanapier</i>, a maker of
<i>hanaps</i>, <i>i.e</i>. goblets. Fr. <i>hanap</i> is from Old
High Ger. <i>hnapf</i> <i>(Napf)</i>, and shows the inability of
French to pronounce initial <i>hn</i>- without inserting a vowel:
cf. <i>harangue</i> from Old High Ger. <i>hring</i>. There is
also a Mid. Eng. <i>nap</i>, cup, representing the cognate
Anglo-Sax. <i>hnaep</i>, so that the name <i>Napper</i> may
sometimes be a doublet of <i>Hamper</i>, though it is more
probably for <i>Napier</i> (Chapter I) or <i>Knapper</i> (Chapter
XII). The common noun <i>hamper</i> is from <i>hanapier</i> in a
sense something like plate-basket. With metal-workers we may also
put <i>Furber</i> or <i>Frobisher</i>, <i>i.e</i>. furbisher, of
armour, etc. <i>Poyser</i>, from <i>poise</i>, scales, is
official. Two occupative names of Celtic origin are <i>Gow</i>, a
smith, as in <i>The</i> <i>Fair</i> <i>Maid</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Perth</i>, and <i>Caird</i>, a tinker&mdash;</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">A few more names, which fall
into no particular category, may conclude the chapter.
<i>Hillyer</i> or <i>Hellier</i> is an old name for a
<i>Thacker</i>, or thatcher, of which we have the Dutch form in
<i>Dekker</i>. It comes from Mid. Eng. <i>helen</i>, to cover up.
In <i>Hillard</i>, <i>Hillyard</i> we sometimes have the same
name (cf. the vulgar <i>scholard)</i>, but these are more often
local (Chapter XIII). <i>Hellier</i> also meant tiler, for the
famous Wat is described as <i>tiler</i>, <i>tegheler</i>, and
<i>hellier</i>.</font></p>


<p>An <i>Ashburner</i> prepared wood-ash for the <i>Bloomer</i>
(Chapter XV), and perhaps also for the <i>Glaisher</i>, or
glass-maker, and <i>Asher</i> <i>is</i> best explained in the
same way, for we do not, I think, add -<i>er</i> to tree-names.
Apparent exceptions can be easily accounted for, e.g.
<i>Elmer</i> <i>is</i> Anglo-Sax. AElfmaer, and <i>Beecher</i>
<i>is</i> Anglo-Fr. <i>bechur</i>, digger (Fr.
<i>b&ecirc;che</i>, spade). Neither <i>Pitman</i> nor
<i>Collier</i> had their modern meaning of coal-miner.
<i>Pitman</i> <i>is</i> local, of the same class as
<i>Bridgeman</i>, <i>Pullman</i>, etc., and <i>Collier</i> meant
a charcoal-burner, as in the famous ballad of Rauf Colyear. Not
much coal was dug in the Middle Ages. Even in 1610 Camden speaks
with disapproval, in his <i>Britannia</i>, of the inhabitants of
Sherwood Forest who, with plenty of wood around them, persist in
digging up "stinking pit-cole."</p>

<p>There is of course no reason why such a list should not be

long enough to make the reader feel dizzy. The fact is that there
is no getting away from a surname of this class, and the bearer
must try to look on the brighter side of the tragedy.
<i>Brewer</i> is occasionally an accommodated form of the French
name Bruy&egrave;re or Labruy&egrave;re, but is usually derived
from an occupation which is the high-road to the House of Lords.
The ancestor of any modern <i>Barber</i> may, like Salvation
Yeo's father, have "exercised the mystery of a barber-surgeon,"
which is getting near the learned professions. A <i>Pottinger</i>
(Chapter XV) looked after the soups, Fr. <i>potage</i>, but the

usually call a farmer are preserved in the surnames <i>Bond</i>
(Chapter XV), whence the compound <i>Husband</i>, used both for
the goodman of the house and in the modern sense, and
<i>Tillman</i>. The labouring man was <i>Day</i>, from the same
root as Ger. <i>Dienen</i>, to serve. It persists in "dairy" and
perhaps in the puzzling name <i>Doubleday</i> <i>(?</i> doing two
men's work). A similar meaning is contained in the names
<i>Swain</i>, <i>Hind</i>, for earlier <i>Hine</i> (Chapter III),
<i>Tasker</i>, <i>Mann</i>. But a <i>Wager</i> was a mercenary
soldier. The mower has given us the names <i>Mather</i> (cf.
after<i>math</i>), and <i>Mawer</i>, while <i>Fenner</i>
<i>is</i> sometimes for Old Fr. <i>feneur</i>, haymaker (Lat.
<i>foenum</i>, hay). For mower we also find the latinized
<i>messor</i>, whence <i>Messer</i>. Whether the <i>Ridler</i>
and the <i>Sivier</i> made, or used, riddles and sieves can
hardly be decided. <i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Riddle</i> is the usual
word for sieve in the Midlands. Hence the phrase "riddled with
holes, or wounds."<i>]</i></font></p>
<p>With the <i>Wenman</i>, who drove the wain, we may mention the
<i>Leader</i> or <i>Loader</i>. The verbs "lead" and "load" are
etymologically the same, and in the Midlands people talk of
"leading," <i>i.e</i>. carting, coal. But these names could also
come from residence near an artificial watercourse (Chapter
XIII). <i>Beecher</i> has already been explained, and
<i>Shoveler</i> <i>is</i> formed in the same way from dialect

surnames drawn from rural occupations are connected with the care
of animals. We find names of this class in three forms,
exemplified by <i>Coltman</i>, <i>Goater</i>, <i>Shepherd</i>,
and it seems likely that the endings -<i>er</i> and -<i>erd</i>
have sometimes been interchanged, e.g. that <i>Goater</i> may
stand for goat-herd, <i>Calver</i> for calf-herd, and
<i>Nutter</i> sometimes for northern <i>nowt</i>-<i>herd</i>,
representing the dialect neat-herd. The compounds of herd include
<i>Bullard</i>, <i>Calvert</i>, <i>Coltard</i>, <i>Coward</i>,
for cow-herd, not of course to be confused with the common noun
<i>coward</i> (Fr. <i>couard</i>, a derivative of Lat.
<i>cauda</i>, tail), <i>Evart</i>, ewe-herd, but also a Norman
spelling of Edward, <i>Geldard</i>, <i>Goddard</i>, sometimes for
goat-herd, <i>Hoggart</i>, often confused with the local
<i>Hogarth</i> (Chapter XIII), <i>Seward</i>, for sow-herd, or
for the historic Siward, <i>Stobart</i>, dialect <i>stob</i>, a

<i>Weatherhead</i>, sometimes a perversion of wether-herd, though
usually a nickname, sheep's head. The man in charge of the tups,
or rams, was called <i>Tupman</i> or <i>Tupper</i>, the latter
standing sometimes for tup-herd, just as we have the imitative
<i>Stutter</i> for <i>Stodart</i> or <i>Studdart</i>. We have
also <i>Tripper</i> from <i>trip</i>, a dialect word for flock,
probably related to troop. Another general term for a herdsman

come from the titles of rural officials and are often confused
with compounds of -<i>herd</i>, they are all put together here.
The simple <i>Ward</i>, cognate with Fr. <i>garde</i>, is one of
our commonest surnames. Like its derivative <i>Warden</i> it had
a very wide range of meanings. The antiquity of the office of
church-warden is shown by the existence of the surname
<i>Churchward</i>. Sometimes the surname comes from the abstract
or local sense, <i>de</i> <i>la</i> <i>warde</i>. As the suffix
-<i>weard</i> occurs very frequently in Anglo-Saxon personal
names, it is not always possible to say whether a surname is
essentially occupative or not, e.g. whether <i>Durward</i> is
rather "door-ward" or for Anglo-Sax. Deorweard. <i>Howard</i>,
which is phonetically Old Fr. Huard, is sometimes also for
<i>Hayward</i> or <i>Haward</i> (Hereward), or for
<i>Hayward</i>. It has no doubt interchanged with the local
<i>Howarth</i>, <i>Haworth</i>.</p>
<p>Owing to the loss of <i>w</i>- in the second part of a word
(Chapter III), -<i>ward</i> and -<i>herd</i> often fall together,
e.g. <i>Millard</i> for <i>Milward</i>, and <i>Woodard</i> found
in Mid. English as both <i>wode</i>-<i>ward</i> and
<i>wode</i>-<i>hird</i>. <i>Hayward</i> belongs to <i>hay</i>,
hedge, enclosure (Chapter XIII), from which we also get
<i>Hayman</i>. The same functionary has given the name
<i>Haybittle</i>, a compound of beadle. <i>Burward</i> and
<i>Burrard</i> may represent the once familiar office of
bear-ward; cf. <i>Berman</i>. I had a schoolfellow called
<i>Lateward</i>, apparently the man in charge of the <i>lade</i>
or <i>leet</i> (Chapter XIII). <i>Medward</i> is for
mead-ward.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>The name <i>Stewart</i> or <i>Stuart</i> became royal with
Walter the Steward of Scotland, who married Marjorie Bruce in
1315. It stands for sty-ward, where sty means pen, not
necessarily limited to pigs. Like most official titles, it has
had its ups and downs, with the result that its present meaning
ranges from a high officer of the crown to the sympathetic
concomitant of a rough crossing.</p>
<p>The <i>Reeve</i>, Anglo-Sax. <i>ge</i>-<i>refa</i>, was in
Chaucer a kind of land agent, but the name was also applied to
local officials, as in port-reeve, shire-reeve. It is the same as
<i>Grieve</i>, also originally official, but used in Scotland of
a land steward&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p>"He has got a ploughman from Scotland who acts as

</div>
</div>
<p>This may be one source of the names <i>Graves</i> and
<i>Greaves</i>. The name <i>Woodruff</i>, <i>Woodroffe</i> is too
common to be referred to the plant woodruff, and the fact that
the male and female of a species of sand-piper are called the
<i>ruff</i> and <i>reeve</i> suggests that Woodruff may have some
relation to wood-reeve. It is at any rate a curious coincidence
that the German name for the plant is <i>Waldmeister</i>,
wood-master. Another official surname especially connected with
country life is <i>Pinder</i>, also found as <i>Pinner</i>,
<i>Pender</i>, <i>Penner</i>, <i>Ponder</i> and <i>Poynder</i>,
the man in charge of the pound or pinfold; cf. <i>Parker</i>, the
custodian of a park, of which the <i>Palliser</i> or
<i>Pallister</i> made the palings.</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80793" id="Toc80793">ITINERANT
MERCHANTS</a></b></p>
<p>The itinerant dealer was usually called by a name suggesting
the pack which he carried. Thus <i>Badger</i>, <i>Kidder</i>,
<i>Kiddier</i>, <i>Pedder</i>, now pedlar, are from <i>bag</i>,
<i>kid</i>, related to <i>kit</i>, and the obsolete p<i>ed</i>,
basket; cf. <i>Leaper</i>, Chapter XV. The badger, who dealt
especially in corn, was unpopular with the rural population, and
it is possible that his name was given to the stealthy animal
formerly called the <i>bawson</i> (Chapter I.), <i>brock</i> or
<i>gray</i> (Chapter XXIII). That <i>Badger</i> is a nickname
taken from the animal is chronologically improbable, as the word
is first recorded in 1523 <i>(New</i> <i>English</i>
<i>Dictionary)</i>.</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">To the above names may be added
<i>Cremer</i>, <i>Cramer</i>, a huckster with a stall in the
market, but this surname is sometimes of modern introduction,
from its German cognate <i>Kr&auml;mer</i>, now generally used
for a grocer. <i>Packman</i>, <i>Pakeman</i>, and <i>Paxman</i>
belong more probably to the font-name <i>Pack</i> (Chapter IX),
which also appears in <i>Paxon</i>, either Pack's son, or for the
local <i>Paxton</i>.</font></p>
<p>The name <i>Hawker</i> does not belong to this group. Nowadays
a hawker is a pedlar, and it has been assumed, without sufficient
evidence, that the word is of the same origin as huckster. The
Mid. Eng. <i>le</i> <i>haueker</i> or <i>haukere</i> (1273) is
quite plainly connected with hawk, and the name may have been
applied either to a <i>Falconer</i>, <i>Faulkner</i>, or to a
dealer in hawks. As we know that itinerant vendors of hawks
travelled from castle to castle, it is quite possible that our
modern hawker is an extended use of the same name.</p>
<p>Nor is the name <i>Coster</i> to be referred to costermonger,
originally a dealer in costards, <i>i.e</i>. apples. It is
sometimes for Mid. Eng. <i>costard</i> (cf. such names as
<i>Cherry</i> and <i>Plumb)</i>, but may also represent Port.
<i>da</i> <i>Costa</i> and Ger. <i>K&ouml;ster</i>, both of which
are found in early lists of Protestant refugees.</p>
<p><i>Jagger</i> was a north-country name for a man who worked
draught-horses for hire. Mr. Hardy's novel <i>Under</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Greenwood</i> <i>Tree</i> opens with "the
<i>Tranter's</i> party." A carrier is still a "tranter" in
Wessex. In Medieval Latin he was called <i>travetarius</i>, a
word apparently connected with Lat. <i>transvehere</i>, to
transport.</p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">It is a well-known fact that
official nomenclature largely reflects the simple housekeeping of
early times, and that many titles, now of great dignity, were
originally associated with rather lowly duties. We have seen an
example in <i>Stewart</i>. Another is <i>Chamberlain</i>. Hence
surnames drawn from this class are susceptible of very varied
interpretation. A <i>Chancellor</i> was originally a man in
charge of a chancel, or grating, Lat. <i>cancelli</i>. In Mid.
English it is usually glossed <i>scriba</i>, while it is now
limited to very high judicial or political office. <i>Bailey</i>,
as we have seen (Chapter IV), has also a wide range of meanings,
the ground idea being that of care-taker. Cotgrave explains Old

</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Every family name is
etymologically a nickname, <i>i.e</i>. an eke-name, intended to
give that auxiliary information which helps in identification.
But writers on surnames have generally made a special class of
those epithets which were originally conferred on the bearer in
connection with some characteristic feature, physical or moral,
or some adjunct, often of the most trifling description, with
which his personality was associated. Of nicknames, as of other
things, it may be said that there is nothing new under the sun.
Ovidius Naso might have received his as a schoolboy, and
<i>Moss</i> <i>cum</i> <i>nano</i>, whom we find in Suffolk in
1184, lives on as "Nosey Moss" in Whitechapel. Some of our
nicknames occur as personal names in Anglo-Saxon times (Chapter
VII), but as surnames they are seldom to be traced back to that
period, for the simple reason that such names were not
hereditary. An Anglo-Saxon might be named <i>Wulf</i>, but his
son would bear another name, while our modern <i>Wolfe</i> does
not usually go farther back than some Ranulf <i>le</i>
<i>wolf</i> <i>of</i> the thirteenth or fourteenth century. This
is of course stating the case broadly, because the personal name
Wolf also persisted and became in some cases a surname. In this
and the following chapters I do not generally attempt to
distinguish between such double origins.</font></p>
<p>Nicknames are formed in very many ways, but the two largest
classes are sobriquets taken from the names of animals, e.g.
<i>Hogg</i>, or from adjectives, either alone or accompanied by a
noun, e.g. <i>Dear</i>, <i>Goodfellow</i>. Each of these classes
requires a chapter to itself, while here we may deal with the
smaller groups.</p>
<p>Some writers have attempted to explain all apparent nicknames
as popular perversions of surnames belonging to the other three
classes. As the reader will already have noticed, such
perversions are extremely common, but it is a mistake to try to
account for obvious nicknames in this way. Any of us who retain a
vivid recollection of early days can call to mind nicknames
<i>of</i> the most fantastic kind, and in some cases of the most
apparently impossible formation, which stuck to their possessors
all through school-life. A very simple test for the genuineness
of a nickname is a comparison with other languages. Camden says
that <i>Drinkwater</i> <i>is</i> a corruption of Derwentwater.
The incorrectness of this guess is shown by the existence as
surnames of Fr. <i>Boileau</i>, It. <i>Bevilacqua</i>, and Ger.
<i>Trinkwasser</i>. It is in fact a perfectly natural nickname
for a medieval eccentric, the more normal attitude being
represented by Roger <i>Beyvin</i> <i>(boi</i>-<i>vin)</i>, who
died in London in 1277.</p>

<p>Corresponding to our <i>Goodday</i>, we find Ger.
<i>Gutentag</i> and Fr. <i>Bonjour</i>. The latter has been
explained as from a popular form of George, but the English and
German names show that the explanation is. unnecessary. With
<i>Dry</i> we may compare Fr. <i>Lesec</i> and Ger.
<i>D&uuml;rr</i>, with <i>Garlick</i> Ger. <i>Knoblauch</i>
(Chapter XV), and with <i>Shakespeare</i> <i>Ger.
Sch&uuml;ttespeer</i>. <i>Luck</i> is both for Luke and Luick
(Li&egrave;ge, Chapter XI), but Rosa <i>Bonheur</i> and the
composer <i>Gluck</i> certify it also as a nickname.
<i>Merryweather</i> is like Fr. <i>Bontemps</i>, and
<i>Littleboy</i> appears in the Paris Directory as
<i>Petitgas</i>, <i>gas</i> being the same as <i>gars</i>, the
old nominative (Chapter I) of <i>gar&ccedil;on</i>&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Bardsley explains
<i>Twentyman</i> as an imitative corruption of
<i>twinter</i>-<i>man</i>, the man in charge of the twinters,
two-year-old colts. This may be so, but there is a German
confectioner in Hampstead called <i>Zwanziger</i>, and there are
Parisians named <i>Vingtain</i>. <i>Lover</i> <i>is</i> confirmed
by the French surnames <i>Amant</i> and <i>Lamoureux</i>, and
<i>Wellbeloved</i> by <i>Bienaim&eacute;</i>. <i>Allways</i> may
be the literal equivalent of the French name <i>Partout</i>. On
the other hand, the name Praisegod <i>Barebones</i> has been
wrongly fixed on an individual whose real name was Barbon or
Barborne.</font></p>
<p>It may seem strange that the nickname, conferred essentially
on the individual, and often of a very offensive character,
should have persisted and become hereditary. But schoolboys know
that, in the case of an unpleasant nickname, the more you try to
pull it off, the more it sticks the faster. <i>Malapert</i> and
<i>Lehideux</i> are still well represented in the Paris
Directory. Many objectionable nicknames have, however,
disappeared, or have been so modified as to become
inoffensive.</p>
<p>Sometimes such disappearance has resulted from the
depreciation in the meaning of a word, e.g. <i>le</i>
<i>lewd</i>, the layman, the unlettered, was once as common as
its opposite <i>le</i> <i>learned</i>, whence the name
<i>Larned</i>. But many uncomplimentary names are no longer
objected to because their owners do not know their earlier
meanings. A famous hymn-writer of the eighteenth century bore all
unconsciously a surname that would almost have made Rabelais
blush. Drinkdregs, Drunkard, Sourale, Sparewater, Sweatinbed,

<p>A very interesting group of surnames consists of those which
indicate degrees of kinship or have to do with the relations
existing between individuals. We find both <i>Master</i> and
<i>Mann</i>, united in <i>Masterman</i>, meaning the man in the
service of one locally known as the master. With this we may
compare <i>Ladyman</i>, <i>Priestman</i>, etc. But <i>Mann</i>
<i>is</i> often of local origin, from the Isle of Man. In some
cases such names are usually found with the patronymic -<i>s</i>,
e.g. <i>Masters</i>, <i>Fellows</i>, while in others this is
regularly absent, e.g. <i>Guest</i>, <i>Friend</i>. The latter
name is sometimes a corruption of Mid. Eng. <i>fremed</i>,
stranger, cognate with Ger. <i>fremd</i>, <i>so</i> that opposite
terms, which we find regularly contrasted in Mid. Eng.
"<i>frend</i> and <i>fremed</i>,<i>"</i> have become absorbed in
one surname.</p>
<p>The frequent occurrence of <i>Fellows</i> <i>is</i> due to its
being sometimes for the local <i>Fallows</i>. From Mid. Eng.
<i>fere</i>, a companion, connected with <i>faren</i>, to travel,
we get <i>Littlefair</i> and <i>Playfair</i>. In Wyclif's Bible

<p>In surnames taken from words indicating family relationship we
come across some survivals of terms no longer used, or occurring
only in rustic dialect. The Mid. Eng. <i>eme</i>, uncle, cognate
with Ger. <i>Oheim</i>, has given <i>Eames</i>. In Chaucer's
<i>Troilus</i> <i>and</i> <i>Criseyde</i>, the heroine addresses
Pandarus as "uncle dere" and "uncle mine," but also uses the
older word&mdash;</p>

Shakespearean <i>nuncle</i>, <i>Lear</i>, <i>i</i>. <i>4)</i>.
The names derived from cousin have been reinforced by those from

<p><i>Child</i> was sometimes used in the special sense of youth
of gentle blood, or young knight; cf. Childe Harold and Childe
Rowland <i>(Lear</i>, iii. 4). But the more general meaning may
be assumed in its compounds, of which the most interesting is
<i>Leifchild</i>, dear-child, a fairly common name in
Anglo-Saxon. The corresponding <i>Faunt</i>, whence
<i>Fauntleroy</i> (Chapter XV), is now rare. Another word, now
only used in dialect or by affectation, is "bairn," a frequent
source of the very common surname <i>Barnes;</i> cf.
<i>Fairbairn</i> and <i>Goodbairn</i>, often perverted to
<i>Fairburn</i>, <i>Goodburn</i>, <i>Goodban</i>.
<i>Barnfather</i> is about equivalent to Lat.

<p>If <i>Ivimey</i> is from this source, the same origin must
sometimes be allowed to <i>Holliman</i> (Chapter I). This
conjecture <i>[Footnote:</i> Probably a myth. See my
<i>Surnames</i>, p. 197.<i>]</i> has in its favour the fact that
many of our surnames are undoubtedly derived from characters
assumed in dramatic performances and popular festivities. To this
class belong many surnames which have the form of abstract nouns,
e.g. <i>Charity</i>, <i>Verity</i>, <i>Virtue</i>, <i>Vice</i>.
Of similar origin are perhaps <i>Bliss</i>, <i>Chance</i>,
<i>Luck</i>, and <i>Goodluck;</i> cf. <i>Bonaventure</i>.
<i>Love</i>, <i>Luff</i>, occurs generally as a personal name,
hence the dim. <i>Lufkins</i>, but it is sometimes a nickname.
<i>Lovell</i>, <i>Lovett</i>, more often mean little wolf. Both
<i>Louvet</i> and <i>Louveau</i> are common French surnames. The
name <i>Lovell</i>, in the wolf sense, was often applied to a
dog, as in the famous couplet</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
"The ratte, the catte, and <i>Lovell</i>, our dogge

</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">for which William Collingborne

<i>Lovell</i>.</font></p>
<p>But many apparent abstract names are due to folk-etymology,
e.g. <i>Marriage</i> is local, Old Fr. <i>marage</i>, marsh, and
<i>Wedlock</i> is imitative for <i>Wedlake;</i> cf.
<i>Mortlock</i> for Mortlake and perhaps <i>Diplock</i> for
deep-lake. <i>Creed</i> is the Anglo-Saxon personal name Creda.
<i>Revel</i>, a common French surname, is a personal name of
obscure origin. <i>Want</i> is the Mid. Eng. <i>wont</i>, mole,
whence <i>Wontner</i>, mole-catcher. It is difficult to see how
such names as <i>Warr</i>, <i>Battle</i>, and <i>Conquest</i>
came into existence. The former, found as <i>de</i> <i>la</i>
<i>warre</i>, is no doubt sometimes local (Chapter XIII), and
<i>Battle</i> is a dim. of Bat (Chapter VI). But <i>de</i>
<i>la</i> <i>batayle</i> is also a common entry, and
<i>Laguerre</i> and <i>Labataille</i> are common French
surnames.</p>

external object regularly associated with the individual. Names
taken from shop-signs really belong to this class. Corresponding
to our <i>Hood</i> <i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Hood</i> may also be for
Hud (Chapter I), but the garment is made into a personal name in
Little Red Ridinghood, who is called in French <i>le</i>
<i>petit</i> <i>Chaperon</i> <i>Rouge</i>.<i>]</i> we have Fr.
<i>Capron</i> <i>(chaperon)</i>. <i>Burdon</i>, Fr.
<i>bourdon</i>, meant a staff, especially a pilgrim's staff.

</div>
</div>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">But the name <i>Burdon</i> is
also local. <i>Bracegirdle</i>, <i>i.e</i>. breeks-girdle, must
have been the nickname of one who wore a gorgeous belt. It is a
curious fact that this name is chiefly found in the same region
(Cheshire) as the somewhat similar <i>Broadbelt</i>. The Sussex
name <i>Quaile</i> represents the Norman pronunciation of coif.
More usually an adjective enters into such combinations. With the
historic Curthose, Longsword, Strongbow we may compare
<i>Shorthouse</i>, a perversion of shorthose, <i>Longstaff</i>,
<i>Horlock</i> (hoar), <i>Silverlock</i>, <i>Whitlock</i>,
<i>etc</i>. <i>Whitehouse</i> is usually of local origin, but has
also absorbed the medieval names Whitehose and White-hawse, the
latter from Mid. Eng. <i>hawse</i>, neck. <i>Woollard</i> may be
the Anglo-Saxon personal name Wulfweard, but is more probably
from <i>woolward</i>, <i>i.e</i>. without linen, a costume
assumed as a sign of penitence</font></p>

<i>Medlicott</i>, and <i>Motley</i> go together, though all three
of them may be local (the mid-lea, the middle-cot, and the
moat-lea). <i>Medley</i> mixed, is the Anglo-French past
participle of Old Fr. <i>mesler</i> <i>(m&ecirc;ler)</i>.
<i>Motley</i> is of unknown origin, but it was not necessarily a
fool's dress&mdash;</font></p>

<p><i>Gildersleeve</i> is now
rare in England, though it still flourishes in the United States.
[Footnote: We have several instances of this phenomenon. A
familiar example is <i>Lippincott</i>, a surname of local origin
(Devonshire). But Bardsley's inclusion of American statistics is
often misleading. It is a well-known fact that the foreign names
of immigrants are regularly assimilated to English forms in the
United States. In some cases, such as Cook for <i>Koch</i>, Cope
(Chapter XII) for <i>Kopf</i>, Stout (Chapter XXII) for
<i>Stolz</i> or <i>Stultz</i>,
the change is etymologically justified. But in other cases, such
as Tallman for <i>Thalmann</i>, dale-man, Trout for <i>Traut</i>, faithful, the
resemblance is accidental. Beam and Chestnut, common in the
States but very rare in England, represent an imitative form of
<i>B&ouml;hm</i> or <i>Behm</i>, Bohemian, and a translation of <i>Kestenbaum</i>,
chestnut tree, both Jewish names. The Becks and Bowmans of New
York outnumber those of London by about five to one, the first
being for <i>Beck</i>, baker (Chapter XV), and the second for <i>Baumann</i>,
equivalent to <i>Bauer</i>, farmer. Bardsley explains the common
American name Arrison by the fact that there are Cockneys in
America. It comes of course from Arend, a Dutch name related to
Arnold.<br>
<br>
"A remarkable record in changes of surname was cited some
years ago by an American correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i>.
'The changes which befell a resident of New
Orleans were that when he moved from an American quarter to a
German neighbourhood his name of Flint became Feuerstein, which
for convenience was shortened to Stein. Upon his removal to a
French district he was re-christened Pierre. Hence upon his
return to an English neighbourhood he was translated into Peters,
and his first neighbours were surprised and puzzled to find Flint
turned Peters.'"</p>

<p><b><a name="Toc80801" id="Toc80801">PHYSICAL
FEATURES</a></b></p>
<p>Names like <i>Beard</i>, <i>Chinn</i>, <i>Tooth</i> were
conferred because of some prominent feature. In Anglo-French we
find <i>Gernon</i>, moustache, now corrupted to <i>Garnham</i>,
and also <i>al</i> <i>gernon</i>, with the moustache, which has
become <i>Algernon</i>. But we have already seen (Chapter XIII)
that some names which appear to belong to this class are of local
origin. So also <i>Tongue</i> is derived from one of several
places named Tong or Tonge, though the ultimate origin is perhaps
in some cases the same, a "tongue" of land. <i>Quartermain</i> is
for <i>Quatre</i>-<i>mains</i>, perhaps bestowed on a very
acquisitive person; Joscius <i>Quatre</i>-<i>buches</i>, four
mouths, and Roger <i>Tunekes</i>, two necks, were alive in the
twelfth century; and there is record of a Saracen champion named
<i>Quinze</i>-<i>paumes</i>, though this is perhaps rather a
measure of height. <i>Cheek</i> I conjecture to be for
<i>Chick</i>. The odd-looking <i>Kidney</i> is apparently Irish.
There is a rare name <i>Poindexter</i>, appearing in French as
<i>Poingdestre</i>, <i>"</i>right fist." <i>[Footnote:</i>
President <i>Poincar&eacute;'s</i> name appears to mean "square
fist."<i>]</i> I have seen it explained as from the heraldic term
<i>point</i> <i>dexter</i>, but it is rather to be taken
literally. I find Johannes <i>cum</i> <i>pugno</i> in 1184, and
we can imagine that such a name may have been conferred on a
medieval bruiser. There is also the possibility, considering the
brutality of many old nicknames, that the bearer of the name had
been judicially deprived of his right hand, a very common
punishment, especially for striking a feudal superior. Thus
Renaut de Montauban, finding that his unknown opponent is
Charlemagne, exclaims&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pettigrew</i> and <i>Pettifer</i> are of French origin,
<i>pied</i> <i>de</i> <i>grue</i> (crane) and <i>pied</i>
<i>de</i> <i>fer</i>. The former is the origin of the word
pedigree, from a sign used in drawing genealogical trees. The
Buckinghamshire name <i>Puddifoot</i> or <i>Puddephatt</i>
<i>(Podefat</i>, 1273) and the aristocratic <i>Pauncefote</i> are
unsolved. The former may be a corruption of <i>Pettifer</i>,
which occurs commonly, along with the intermediate
<i>Puddifer</i>, in the same county. But the <i>English</i>
<i>Dialect</i> <i>Dictionary</i> gives as an obsolete Northants
word the adjective p<i>uddy</i>, stumpy, pudgy, applied
especially to hands, fingers, etc., and Pudito (puddy toe) occurs
as a surname in the <i>Hundred</i> <i>Rolls</i>. As for
<i>Pauncefote</i>, I believe it simply means what it appears to,
viz. "belly-foot," a curious formation, though not without
parallels, among obsolete rustic nicknames. If these two
conjectures are correct, both Puddifoot and Pauncefote may be
almost literal equivalents of the Greek OEdipus, <i>i.e</i>.
"swell-foot."</p>
<p>In other languages as well as English we find money nicknames.
It is easy to understand how some of these come into existence,
e.g. that Pierce. Pennilesse was the opposite of Thomas
Thousandpound, whose name occurs <i>c</i>. 1300. With the latter
we may compare Fr. <i>Centlivre</i>, the name of an English lady
dramatist of the eighteenth century. <i>Moneypenny</i> is found
in 1273 as <i>Manipeni</i>, and a Londoner named <i>Manypeny</i>
died in 1348. The <i>Money</i>- is partly north country, partly
imitative.</p>
<p><i>Money</i> itself is usually occupative or local (Chapter
XVII), and <i>Shilling</i> is the Anglo-Saxon name Scilling. The
oldest and commonest of such nicknames is the simple
<i>Penny</i>, with which we may compare the German surname
<i>Pfennig</i> and its compounds <i>Barpfennig</i>,
<i>Weisspfennig</i>, etc. The early adoption of this coin-name as
a personal name is due to the fact that the word was taken in the
sense of money in general. We still speak of a rich man as "worth
a pretty penny." <i>Hallmark</i> is folk-etymology for the
medieval <i>Half</i>-<i>mark</i>. Such medieval names as
<i>Four</i>-<i>pence</i>, <i>Twenty</i>-<i>mark</i>, <i>etc</i>.,
probably now obsolete, are paralleled by Fr. <i>Quatresous</i>
and <i>Sixdenier</i>, still to be found in the Paris Directory.
It would be easy to form conjectures as to the various ways in
which such names may have come into existence. To the same class
must belong <i>Besant</i>, the name of a coin from Byzantium, its
foreign origin giving it a dignity which is absent from the
native <i>Farthing</i> and <i>Halfpenny</i>, though the latter,
in one instance, was improved beyond recognition into
<i>MacAlpine</i>.</p>

that Palsgrave, the French tutor of Princess Mary Tudor, includes

examples are "Le grant diable luy rompe le col et les deux

abridged form of "Le feu Saint Anthoyne l'arde" <i>[Footnote:</i>

<p><b><a name="Toc80803" id="Toc80803">PHRASE-NAMES</a></b></p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting group of nicknames is that of
which we may take <i>Shakespeare</i> as the type. Incidentally we
should be thankful that our greatest poet bore a name so much
more picturesque than <i>Corneille</i>, crow, or <i>Racine</i>,
root. It is agreed among all competent scholars that in compounds
of this formation the verb was originally an imperative. This is
shown by the form; cf. <i>ne'er</i>-<i>do</i>-<i>well</i>, Fr.
<i>vaurien</i>, Ger. <i>Taugenichts</i>, good-for-naught. Thus
<i>Hasluck</i> cannot belong to this class, but must be an
imitative form of the personal name Aslac, which we find in
Aslockton.</p>
<p>As Bardsley well says, it is impossible to retail all the
nonsense that has been written about the name
<i>Shakespeare</i>&mdash;"never a name in English nomenclature so
simple or so certain in its origin; it is exactly what it
looks&mdash; <i>shake</i>-<i>spear</i>." The equivalent
<i>Sch&uuml;ttespeer</i> is found in German, and we have also in
English <i>Shakeshaft</i>, <i>Waghorn</i>, <i>Wagstaff</i>,
<i>Breakspear</i>, <i>Winspear</i>. "<i>Winship</i> the mariner"
was a freeman of York in the fourteenth century. Cf.
<i>Benbow</i> (bend-bow), <i>Hurlbatt</i>, and the less athletic
<i>Lovejoy</i>, <i>Makepeace</i>. <i>Gathergood</i> and its
opposite <i>Scattergood</i> are of similar origin, <i>good</i>
having here the sense of goods. <i>Dogood</i> is sometimes for
<i>Toogood</i>, and the latter may be, like <i>Thoroughgood</i>,
an imitative form of <i>Thurgod</i> (Chapter VII); but both names
may also be taken literally, for we find Ger. <i>Thunichtgut</i>,
do no good, and Fr. <i>Trodoux</i> <i>(trop</i> <i>doux)</i>.</p>
<p>As a pendant to <i>Dolittle</i> we find a medieval
<i>Hack</i>-<i>little</i>, no doubt a lazy wood-cutter, while
virtue is represented by a twelfth-century
<i>Tire</i>-<i>little</i>. <i>Sherwin</i> represents the medieval
<i>Schere</i>-<i>wynd</i>, applied to a swift runner; cf. Ger.
<i>Schneidewind</i>, cut wind, and Fr. <i>Tranchevent</i>. A
nurseryman at Highgate has the appropriate name <i>Cutbush</i>,
the French equivalent of which, <i>Taillebois</i>, has given us
<i>Tallboys;</i> and a famous herbalist was named
<i>Culpepper</i>. In <i>Gathercole</i> the second element may
mean cabbage or charcoal. In one case, <i>Horniblow</i> for
horn-blow, the verb comes after its object.</p>
<p>Names of this formation are very common in Mid. English as in
Old French, and often bear witness to a violent or brutal nature.
Thus <i>Scorch</i>-<i>beef</i>, which is found in the Hundred
Rolls, has no connection with careless cookery; it is Old Fr.
<i>escorche</i> <i>(&eacute;corche)</i> -<i>buef</i>, flay ox, a
name given to some medieval "Skin-the-goat." <i>Catchpole</i>
(Chapter XX) is formed in the same way, and in French we find,
applied to law officials, the surnames <i>Baillehart</i>, give
halter, <i>[Footnote:</i> <i>Bailler</i>, the usual Old French
for to give, is still used colloquially and in dialect.<i>]</i>
and <i>Baillehache</i>, give axe, the latter still appropriately
borne, as <i>Bailhache</i>, by an English judge.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been assumed that most names of this class
are due to folk-etymology. The frequency of their occurrence in
Mid. English and in continental languages makes it certain that
the contrary is the case and that many surnames of obscure origin
are perversions of this very large and popular class. I have seen
it stated somewhere that <i>Shakespeare</i> is <i>a</i>
corruption of an Old French name <i>Sacquesp&eacute;e</i>,
<i>[Footnote:</i> Of common occurrence in Mid. English
records.<i>]</i> the theorist being apparently unable to see that
this latter, meaning <i>draw</i>-<i>sword</i>, is merely an
additional argument, if such were needed, for the literal
interpretation of the English name. <i>[Footnote:</i> In one
day's reading I came across the following Mid. English names:
<i>Baillebien</i> (give good), <i>Baysedame</i> (kiss lady),
<i>Esveillechien</i> (wake dog), <i>Lievelance</i> (raise lance),
<i>Metlefrein</i> (put the bridle), <i>Tracepurcel</i> (track
hog), <i>Turnecotel</i> (turn coat), together with the native
<i>Cachehare</i> and <i>Hoppeschort</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Tredgold</i> seems to have been conferred on some medieval
stoic, for we find also <i>Spurnegold</i>. Without pinning our
faith to any particular anecdote, we need have no hesitation in
accepting <i>Turnbull</i> as a sobriquet conferred for some feat
of strength and daring on a stalwart Borderer. We find the
corresponding <i>Tornebeuf</i> in Old French, and <i>Turnbuck</i>
also occurs. <i>Trumbull</i> and <i>Trumble</i> are variants due
to metathesis followed by assimilation (Chapter III), while
<i>Tremble</i> is a very degenerate form. In <i>Knatchbull</i> we
have the obsolete verb <i>knatch</i>, which in Mid. English meant
to strike on the head, fell. <i>Crawcour</i> is Fr.
<i>Cr&egrave;vecoeur</i>, breakheart, which has also become a
local name in France. With <i>Shacklock</i>, shake-lock, and
<i>Sherlock</i>, <i>Shurlock</i>, shear-lock, we may compare
Robin Hood's comrade <i>Scathelock</i>, though the precise
interpretation of all three names is difficult. <i>Rackstraw</i>,
rake-straw, corresponds to Fr. <i>Grattepaille</i>.
<i>Golightly</i> means much the same as <i>Lightfoot</i> (Chapter
XIII), nor need we hesitate to regard the John <i>Gotobed</i> who
lived in Cambridgeshire in 1273 as a notorious sluggard compared
with whom his neighbour Serl <i>Gotokirke</i> was a shining
example. <i>[Footnote:</i> The name is still found in the same
county. Undergraduates contemporary with the author occasionally
slaked their thirst at a riverside inn kept by Bathsheba
Gotobed.]</p>
<p><i>Telfer</i> is Fr. <i>Taillefer</i>, the iron cleaver, and
Henry II.'s yacht captain was Alan <i>Trenchemer</i>, the sea
cleaver. He had a contemporary named <i>Ventados</i>, wind
abaft.</p>
<p><i>Slocomb</i> has assumed a local aspect, but may very well
correspond to Fr. <i>Tardif</i> or Ger. <i>M&uuml;hsam</i>,
applied to some Weary Willie of the Middle Ages. <i>Doubtfire</i>
is a misspelling of <i>Dout</i>-<i>fire</i>, from the dialect
<i>dout</i>, to extinguish (do out), formed like <i>don</i> and
<i>doff</i>. <i>Fullalove</i>, which does not belong to the same
formation, is also found as <i>Plein</i>
<i>d'amour&mdash;</i></p>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">"The man replied that
he did not know the object of the building; and to make it quite
manifest that he really did not know, he put an adjective before
the word 'object,' and another&mdash;that is, the

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The rejection by the British
workman of all adjectives but one is due to the same imaginative
poverty which makes the adjective "nice" supreme in refined
circles, and which limits the schoolgirl to "ripping" and her
more self-conscious brother to the tempered "decent." But dozens
of useful adjectives, now either obsolete or banished to rustic
dialect, are found among our surnames. The tendency to accompany
every noun by an adjective seems to belong to some deep-rooted
human instinct. To this is partly due the Protean character of
this part of speech, for the word, like the coin, becomes dulled
and worn in circulation and needs periodically to be withdrawn
and replaced. An epithet which is complimentary in one generation
is ironical in the next and eventually offensive. <i>Moody</i>,
with its northern form <i>Mudie</i>, which now means morose, was
once valiant (Chapter I); and pert, surviving in the name
<i>Peart</i>, meant active, brisk, etc.&mdash;</font></p>

Eng. <i>crum</i>, crooked, whence the names <i>Crum</i> and
<i>Crump</i>. Ludwig's German Dict. (1715) explains krumm as
"<i>crump</i>, crooked, wry." The name <i>Crook</i> generally has
the same meaning, the Ger. Krummbein corresponding to our
<i>Cruikshank</i> or <i>Crookshanks</i>. It is possible that
<i>Glegg</i> and <i>Gleig</i> are Mid. Eng. <i>gleg</i>, skilful,

<p>There are some adjectival surnames which are not immediately

<i>Deer</i>... The timorous-looking <i>Fear</i> is Fr. <i>le</i>

so many meanings intermediate between its etymological sense of

ADJECTIVES</a></b></p>
<p>A large proportion of our adjectival nicknames are of French
origin. <i>Le</i> <i>bel</i> appears not only as <i>Bell</i> but
also, through Picard, as <i>Beal</i>. Other examples are
<i>Boon</i>, <i>Bone</i>, <i>Bunn</i> (bon), <i>Grant</i>
(grand), <i>Bass</i> (bas) and its derivative <i>Bassett</i>,
<i>Dasent</i> (d&eacute;cent), <i>Follett</i> and
<i>Folliott</i>, dim. of <i>fol</i> (fou), mad, which also
appears in the compound <i>Foljambe</i>, <i>Fulljames</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mordaunt</i> means biting. <i>Power</i> is generally
Anglo-Fr. <i>le</i> <i>poure</i> (le pauvre) and <i>Grace</i> is
for <i>le</i> <i>gras</i>, the fat. <i>Jolige</i> represents the
Old French form of <i>joli&mdash;</i></p>

<p>"<i>Prynne</i>, now <i>Pring</i>, is Anglo-Fr. <i>le prin</i>, the first, from the Old French adjective which
survives in <i>prin</i>temps. Cf. our name <i>Prime</i> and the French name
<i>Premier</i>. The Old French adjective <i>Gent</i>, now replaced by <i>gentil</i>,
generally means slender in Mid. English&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Petty</i> and <i>Pettit</i> are
variant forms of Fr. <i>petit</i>, small. In <i>Prowse</i> and <i>Prout</i> we have
the nominative and objective (Chapter I) of an Old French
adjective now represented by <i>preux</i> and <i>prude</i>, generally thought
to be related in some way to Lat. <i>pro</i> in <i>prosum</i>, and perhaps also
the source of our <i>Proud.</i></p>
<p><i>Gross</i> is of course Fr. <i>le</i> <i>gros</i>, but
<i>Grote</i> represents Du. <i>groot</i>, great, probably
unconnected with the French word. The Devonshire name
<i>Coffin</i>, which is found in that county in the twelfth
century, is the same as <i>Caffyn</i>, perhaps representing Fr.
<i>Chauvin</i>, bald, the name of the theologian whom we know
better in the latinized form <i>Calvin</i>. Here belongs probably
<i>Shovel</i>, Fr. <i>Chauvel</i>. We also have the simple
<i>Chaffe</i>, Old Fr. <i>chauf</i> <i>(chauve)</i>, bald.
<i>Gaylard</i>, sometimes made into the imitative <i>Gaylord</i>,
is Fr. <i>gaillard</i>, brisk, lively</p>

<p>Especially common are colour nicknames, generally due to the
complexion, but sometimes to the garb. As we have already seen
(Chapter XV), <i>Black</i> and its variant <i>Blake</i> sometimes
mean pale. <i>Blagg</i> is the same word; cf. <i>Jagg</i> for
<i>Jack</i>. <i>White</i> has no doubt been reinforced by

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">A few adjective nicknames of
Celtic origin are so common in England that they may be included
here. Such are the Welsh <i>Gough</i>, <i>Goff</i>, <i>Gooch</i>,

<i>Lloyd</i>, grey, <i>Sayce</i>, Saxon, foreigner,
<i>Vaughan</i>, small, and the Gaelic <i>Bain</i>, <i>Bean</i>,
white, <i>Boyd</i>, <i>Bowie</i>, yellow-haired, <i>Dow</i>,
<i>Duff</i>, black, <i>Finn</i>, fair, <i>Glass</i>, grey,
<i>Roy</i>, <i>Roe</i>, red. From Cornish come <i>Coad</i>, old,
and <i>Couch</i>, <i>[Footnote:</i> Cognate with Welsh
<i>Gough</i>.<i>]</i> red, while <i>Bean</i> is the Cornish for
small, and <i>Tyacke</i> means a farmer. It is likely that both
<i>Begg</i> and <i>Moore</i> owe something to the Gaelic
adjectives for little and big, as in the well-known names of
Callum Beg, Edward Waverley's gillie, and McCallum More. The
Gaelic <i>Begg</i> is cognate with the Welsh <i>Vaughan</i>. Two
other famous Highland nicknames which <i>are</i> very familiar in
England are <i>Cameron</i>, crooked nose, and <i>Campbell</i>,
wry mouth. With these may be mentioned the Irish <i>Kennedy</i>,
ugly head, the name of the father of Brian Boru.</font></p>

<p>Among beast nicknames we find special attention given, as in
modern vituperation, to the swine, although we do not find this
true English word, unless it be occasionally disguised as
<i>Swain</i>. <i>Hogg</i> does not belong exclusively to this
class, as it is used in dialect both of a young sheep and a
yearling colt. Anglo-Sax. <i>sugu</i>, sow, survives in
<i>Sugg</i>. <i>Purcell</i> is Old Fr. <i>pourcel</i>
<i>(pourceau)</i>, dim. of Lat. <i>porcus</i>, and I take

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The word <i>shoote</i> in the

<p><i>Grice</i> also represents <i>le gris</i>, the grey; cf. <i>Grace</i>
for <i>le gras</i> (Chapter XXII). <i>Bacon</i>
looks like a nickname, but is invariably found without the
article. As it is common in French, it would appear to be an Old
French accusative to <i>Back</i>, going back to Germanic <i>Bacco</i> (Chapter
XIII). <i>Hinks</i> is Mid. Eng. <i>hengst</i>, a stallion, and is thus
identical with <i>Hengist</i> (Chapter XX). <i>Stott</i> means both a bullock
and a nag (Chapter XIX).</p>
<p>Everyone remembers Wamba's sage disquisition on the names of
animals in the first chapter of <i>Ivanhoe</i>. Like much of
Scott's archaeology it is somewhat anachronistic, for the live
animals were also called veals and muttons for centuries after
Wamba's death</p>

<p><i>Calf</i> has become very
rare as a surname, though <i>Kalb</i> is still common in Germany.
Bardsley regards <i>Duncalf</i> and <i>Metcalf</i>
as perverted from <i>dun-croft</i>
and <i>meadow-croft</i>. It seems possible that they may be for
<i>down-calf</i> and <i>mead-calf</i>, from the locality of the pasture, but
this is a pure guess on my part. It is curious that <i>beef</i> does not
appear to have survived, though <i>Leboeuf</i> is common in French, and
bullocks are still called "beeves" in Scotland. <i>Tegg</i> is still
used by butchers for a two-year-old sheep. Palsgrave gives it
another meaning&mdash; </p>

these Anglo-Saxon names rarely form dims. (Chapter VII).
<i>Luttrel</i> is in French <i>Loutrel</i>, perhaps a dim. of

<p>In early dictionaries may be found long lists of the fanciful
names, such as Bright, Lightfoot, Ranger, Ringwood, Swift,
Tempest, given to hounds. This practice seems to throw some light
on such surnames as <i>Tempest</i>, with which we may compare the
German names <i>Storm</i> and <i>Sturm</i>. In the Pipe Rolls the
name <i>le</i> <i>esturmi</i>, the stormy, occurs several times.
To the same class belongs <i>Thunder</i>, found in the Pipe Rolls

<p><b><a name="Toc80814" id="Toc80814">FISHES</a></b></p>
<p>On fish-names Bardsley remarks, "We may quote the famous
chapter on 'Snakes in Iceland': 'There are no snakes in Iceland,'
and say there are no fish-names in England." This is almost true.
The absence of marked traits of character in the, usually
invisible, fish would militate against the adoption of such
names. We should not expect to find the shark to be represented,
for the word is of too late occurrence. But <i>Whale</i> is
fairly common. <i>Whale</i> the mariner received two pounds from
Henry VII's privy purse in 1498. The story of Jonah, or very
generous proportions, may have originated the name
<i>Whalebelly</i>, "borne by a respectable family in south-east
England" (Bardsley).</p>
<p>But there would obviously be no great temptation to go fishing
for nicknames when the beasts of the farmyard and the forest, the
birds of the marshes and the air, offered on every side easily
understood comparisons. At the same time Bardsley's statement
goes a little too far. He explains <i>Gudgeon</i> as a corruption
of Goodison. But this, true though it may be in some cases, will
not explain the very common French surname <i>Goujon</i>. The
phrase "greedy gudgeon" suggests that in this case a certain
amount of character had been noticed in the fish. <i>Sturgeon</i>
also seems to be a genuine fish-name. We find Fr.
<i>Lesturgeon</i> and Ger. <i>Stoer</i>, both meaning the same.
We have also <i>Smelt</i> and the synonymous <i>Spurling</i>. In
French and German we find other surnames which undoubtedly belong
to this class, but they are not numerous and probably at first
occurred only in regions where fishing or fish-curing were
important industries.</p>
<p>A few examples will show that apparent fish-names are usually
not genuine. <i>Chubb</i> is for Job (Chapter III), <i>Eeles</i>
is one of the numerous derivatives of Elias (Chapter IX),
<i>Hake</i> is, like <i>Hack</i>, from the Scandinavian Hacun,
<i>Haddock</i> is sometimes a perversion of the local Haydock,
<i>Lamprey</i> comes via Old French from Old High Ger.
Landprecht, which has usually given <i>Lambert</i>.</p>
<p><i>Pike</i> <i>is</i> local (Chapter XII), <i>Pilchard</i> is
for <i>Pilcher</i> (Chapter XVIII), <i>Roach</i> is Fr.
<i>Laroche</i>, <i>Salmon</i> is for Salomon, and <i>Turbot</i>
is the Anglo-Sax. Thurbeorht, which has also given <i>Tarbut</i>,
as Thurgod has given <i>Targett</i>. But in few of the above
examples is the possibility of fish origin absolutely
excluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="Toc80815" id="Toc80815">SPECIAL
FEATURES</a></b></p>
<p>We have also many surnames due to physical resemblances not
extending beyond one feature. <i>Birdseye</i> may be sometimes of
local origin, from <i>ey</i>, island (Chapter XII), but as a
genuine nickname it is as natural as the sobriquet of Hawkeye
which Natty Bumppo received from the Hurons. German has the much
less pleasing <i>Gansauge</i>, goose-eye; and Alan <i>Oil</i>
<i>de</i> <i>larrun</i>, thief's eye, was fined for very
reprehensible conduct in 1183. To explain <i>Crowfoot</i> as an
imitative variant of Crawford is absurd when we find a dozen
German surnames of the same class and formation and as many in
Old or Modern French beginning with <i>pied</i> <i>de</i>. Cf.
<i>Pettigrew</i> (Chapter XXI) and <i>Sheepshanks</i>. We find in
the Paris Directory not only <i>Piedeleu</i> (Old Fr. <i>leu</i>,
wolf) and <i>Piedoie</i> <i>(oie</i>, goose), but even the full
<i>Pied</i>-<i>de</i>-<i>Li&egrave;vre</i>, Professeur &agrave;
la Facult&eacute; de droit. The name <i>Bulleid</i> was spelt in
the sixteenth century <i>bul</i>-<i>hed</i>, <i>i.e</i>.
bull-head, a literal rendering of Front de Boeuf.
<i>Weatherhead</i> (Chapter XIX) is perhaps usually a
nickname</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p>"For that old <i>weather-headed</i> fool, I know how to laugh at him."</p>
<div style="margin-left: 12em">
<p>(Congreve, <i>Love</i> <i>for</i> <i>Love</i>, ii. 7.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Coxhead</i> is another
obvious nickname. A careful analysis of some of the most
important medieval name-lists would furnish hundreds of further
examples, some too outspoken to have survived into our degenerate
age, and others which are now so corrupted that their original
vigour is quite lost. </p>
<p>Puns and jokes upon proper names are, <i>pace</i> Gregory the
Great and Shakespeare, usually very inept and stupid; but the
following lines by James Smith, which may be new to some of my
readers, are really clever&mdash;</p>

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
John Lackland, and Peter the Hermit.

But now, when the door-plates of Misters and Dames
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Are read, each so constantly varies
<br>From the owner's trade, figure, and calling, Surnames

The origin and cognates of each word are given as concisely as
possible, but "etymology" has been taken in its widest sense as a
science dealing not only with the phonetic elements of which
words are composed, but also with the adventures which they have
met with during their life in the language and the strange paths
that many of them have followed in reaching a current sense or
use often widely remote from the original. So far as possible,
the date or epoch of the first appearance of each word is noted,
and the book will be found to contain much curious information
for which earlier etymological dictionaries would be ransacked in
vain.</font></p>

<ul>
<li><font face="Bookman Old Style">Although I worked from
material in good condition, scanning and preparing subject matter
of this type is much harder work than preparing a novel or the
like, so obviously I should never have bothered with preparing
this book if I had not though it to be worthwhile. In fact I
consider it to be very rewarding, informative, and entertaining.
I hope you also find it rewarding, and I present it in much the
same mood that I assume it was written in: not that it is fully
correct or definitive, but that both the material and the lines
of thought that the book comprises, are useful, thoughtful, and
enjoyable, taken for what they are worth. The book certainly is
based on a formidable level of erudition, however cheerful the
author&rsquo;s style may be.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For the most part I have tried to remain true to the source,
but this is not an attempt to reproduce the volume I scanned; my
objective was to render its content available. Accordingly, I did
not hesitate to correct minor, obvious errors, or to adopt my
preferences for spacing and the like. Also, the means that I employed
in preparing this material did not lend themselves satisfactorily to
preservation of the original pagination or of numbering and cross
reference of pages. However, as the product is machine readable,
search is easier than working from an index, and I tried to
support the use of such facilities. Anyone who feels strongly
that an index remains necessary, is welcome to add an index to
the version that I have presented here, without crediting me for
the body of the work.</li>
<li>I have however, substituted cross-reference between sections
or chapters for the (now meaningless) cross-references between
pages. Also, like many books of that day, the original had many
page headings such as "MYTHICAL ETYMOLOGIES" or "HILL AND DALE",
without incorporating them in the table of contents or the text,
or even making it clear just where those page headings fitted
into the text. I have changed such page headings to sub-headings
within the text, where they are more useful, given that they no
longer are necessary for the original purpose of aiding the
process of flipping through the pages of a paper book.</li>
<li>I have relocated footnotes from the feet of the pages to just
after the text that they qualified. Apart from thereby rendering
the text less dependent of changes of format, this arguably
renders the footnotes more useful and less disruptive to the
reader. Footnotes are marked as such, so as to avoid
confusion.</li>
<li>I have of course tried to produce as clean a product as
possible, but I apologetically assure you that some errors remain
in the text. You accordingly must treat the content with
appropriate caution.</li>
